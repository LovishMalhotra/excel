Transform,direct,Harriet London,2017-02-15T11:59:27Z,3  stars,Laser Hair Removal,"I am currently a client at transform in the fulham branch, I decided to get laser hair removal as my skin type is fair and i have dark hair and thought it would work best for me. The first few treatments i started to see great improvement and less hair regrowth! But coming to the end of my sessions i have noticed patches where have been missed that are alot coarser than other areas. I also have fine hairs scattered about, according to transform's information you should have complete hair reduction after 6-8 sessions. This isnt the case for me, which is quite annoying after paying a hefty cost! That would be the main reason i would rate 3 stars, i would also say the fulham branch is quite lapsy dasy, on two occasions i turnt up to an appointment and hadnt been booked in from previous appointments. Also on times where they remembered to book me in they were often really bad with time keeping. I found myself waiting for 20 minutes at a time! Overall anyone thinking of undergoing laser hair removal at Transform i would do your research before hand!!",Positive,0.8629,0,0,0,0,0,Laser Hair Removal,0,0,0,0,Transform,cost,time,0,0,research,0,0,0

The pressure was unbearable the surgeon gave me a short time to think about it then came back..I had fasted from the night before as required I felt sick with hunger and was so thirsty. But my nerves were through the roof..how would I get home such a long way. He the surgeon returned saying have uou decided to get an alternative implant meaning cylicone or saline. He was not happy and the way he looked at me was not pleasant at all. I felt scared and helpless I just wanted to be home. In the end up I felt I had no choice it was horrible.

After spending around 13000 pound, I am left with a scar on my tummy which is certainly not aesthetically pleasing, similarly I have been left with breast implants that have encapsulated. Yes I was aware of the risks but believes due to additional insurance I paid I would be okay. As in the small print, I had my implants replaced with a different brand, then after 2nd encapsulation I had them replaced again during my tummy tuck surgery. The 3rd set of implants have again encapsulated. I went to see a different surgeon in transform who suggested after the 2nd attempt he would have suggested placing the implants infringed of the muscle instead as the risk for encapsulation would have been reduced. After the consult I went to see the advisor and asked if this could be done, she said this would cost me another 5and a half thousand, now bearing in mind I was already in nearly 12000 of debt I could not possible afford this, I was gobsmacked, I asked if I could just have the implants removed as I was worried for my health and they were painful, again I was told there wouldn't be a substantial cost for this procedure also, I was very upset and in a no win situation a shame I had no funds to have this done. Knowing my mental health issues and how upset I was I walked out of the room in tears and never even got so much as a phone call to see if I was okay, all they care about it your money.

I think its just to make sure you can pay for the treatment.these people are not trained in medical treatment. a lady call on my husbands phone and said that we need your own phone number not your husbands and when would you like it done will you you be wanting it done in the near future or will you wait a few months. I thought this was going to be a none pushing consolation . they just wanted to know when I wanted it and did I have the money. bad news for them I don't need credit and I don't need to speak with some sales woman and if you can't talk to my husband about it after all he is paying for it for me then I will find another company and not bother going to Birmingham to any meetings .,Positive,0.5908,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,sale,wait,person,0,0,0,0,0

Each time I have had a consultation or review they have issues finding me on their system as instead of updating my patient records I seem to have been put in the system multiple times which shows poor organisation. I had a consultation with my surgeon again before Christmas to review my problem and he told me he?��s out of options and referred me to another surgeon. This is where it gets worse.. after my consultation with the new surgeon who gave me hope we could get me good results I was told he was going to speak to my original surgeon and get back to me with my options.. months of false promises to get a returned phone call each time I call, ignored emails I?��m basically now being ignored in hopes of going away! The only reason I?��m giving 2 stars is because after my first 2 inadequate surgeries they were great at communicating and the process was smooth to try and fix the problem, the reason I couldn?��t possibly give any more is the stress, unhappy results and unbelievable customer service I have received since.

I was so excited as this is something I was desperate to get. I was rushed into the room with my friend (who was having Botox) was told we needed to be quick as there was someone else waiting and the lady doing the fillers finished soon. I trusted that I would look a better version of myself, I left looking as tho I?��d had a stroke. Uneven and I was told I had no top lip and should pay for more filler (having put the majority of filler I?��d paid for into my bottom lip which didn?��t need filler) I was told that they were uneven simply due to swelling, I thought fair enough..  I trusted what they said. I called after a week to say I was concerned about the fact they didn?��t look even.. I was told to wait again as they?��d still be swollen. Eventually after several weeks I got another appointment, I was told that my lips were uneven due to me having crooked teeth!! I was then informed for the bargain price of �180 (half of what I?��d originally paid) she would put that right for me. Ummmmm no thanks! My lips are symmetrical now so I can only assume she had no clue what she was doing, messed it up then tried to charge me to fix it! Unbelievable.

My admission time was 7:30am as I was a day case, the nurse took me to my own private room which I didn?��t expect, I thought I would have been on a shared ward. She took my observations, I was supposed to be first on the list but was held back 2 hours due to having a high blood pressure reading, I think this was probably due to nerves. Once my blood pressure had returned to normal the anethesist came to go through some questions with me, then I met Dr Frati who drew out my markings ready for theatre. Everyone was very kind and caring, I went down to theatre at 10:25am so I didn?��t have to wait very long, I?��m also very scared of needles but the anethesist and the team were brilliant and made me laugh to take my mind off it, although I didn?��t even feel the needle go in. Before I knew it I?��d came round from surgery and felt like I?��d had the best sleep ever. I was sore but not in too much pain it was more discomfort, and a tight feeling. I was moved back to my room and had my bacon sandwich and rested for a few hours whilst the nurses took my observations frequently. At around 4pm Dr Frati came to see me and ask how I was doing, I thanked him for giving me my new boobs, then at 5:30pm my drains were taken out and I was given my antibiotics and painkillers to take with me, then I was discharged at around 6pm. I?��m very pleased with how my surgery day went, and the staff were so polite and helpful, and it all went smoothly as I could?��ve hoped for.

In order for recovery time etc I took 5 weeks off. I paid my �500 deposit to secure the bed in the London hospital and paid for a hotel the night before so I could be there prompt and early. Then I had my pre op assessment which was absolutely terrible. The nurse was unapproachable and I was actually nervous to state I had eczema which is a minor condition. When I interrupted to admit I had mental health problems in the past which was related to other issues (nothing to do with my nose, she looked absolutely disappointed and like she couldn?��t be bothered to deal with the case. My friend who was next to me even pinched my thigh as they saw my disgusted face and then when leaving the appointment my friend said don?��t worry, this is all for your op so you?��ll be in safe hands. Well two days before the op the nurse rang me to say the op is cancelled as the surgeon is not happy that I am mentally fit for surgery. He also apparently stated that I need a PSYCHIATRIC REVIEW to clear me of any mental health issues and to wait six months before I can consider a rhinoplasty. I went to my doctor to ask for a letter to state I had not seen them for three years regarding mental health issues and my surgeon still did not accept this letter. My gp also stated that she was most definitely not going to refer me to a psychiatrist just for them to say I?��m well. All my reasons were clear of why I wanted one and also he did not call me personally to cancel the operation, he had to tell others to tell me. I then asked for my �500 deposit back on 27th of March to which I was told �150 will be kept for pre-operation fees despite not having an operation. And I am still waiting on the �350 I am suppose to receive and it?��s the 18th of May 2018! I cannot contact the number of whoever has my money! It?��s a risk to go with them in all honesty. I am now left with a lack of �500 and that unemployment gap that I took for this surgery certainly isn?��t helping my financial situation.

Transform,direct,Gemma Keulder,2018-03-25T14:45:05Z,2  stars,It has taken me nearly 18months to do this.,"It has taken me nearly 18months to write this review as I wanted to just be clear in my head that I wasn't being dramatic but I still feel the same. I just want to firstly say I could not be happier with the way I was treated by the nursing staff they were lovely from start to finish but the rest I feel was unprofessional and not worth the predicament I am now put in. The first lady I saw in London's clinic was very friendly but didn't really have the knowledge I was hoping for. I then went on to see a surgeon who booked me in and then very promptly went on leave so could not continue with my surgery. I then had to go back to London to meet another surgeon who said the surgery I had booked in for was not the best way to get the results I wanted but we would could change that if we needed to at the time. After getting home and thinking about it I decided that I only wanted to do this once so if more invasive surgery was needed I would go for it. I spoke to my first consultant who then informed me what the surgeon had said was wrong and I couldn't have that surgery unless I started the process again, moved my surgery date and paid more. I was left feeling stuck and lost. I has lost all faith in my surgeon but I was over �6000 in at this point. I went for my surgery as first planned as I was told it would be fine and it would look great. The hospital was lovely and staff were great until my surgeon walked in, she was rude ""apparently you want to change your mind!?"" When I said I was originally under the understanding that I able to do this she replied ""it's to late now"" ( I wasn't even trying to change it as I knew it was to late)",Positive,0.8903,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,time,professional,0,0,0,0,results

When I first met with Mr Jones he told me exactly what I wanted to hear and what I wanted doing to my nose without me saying a word! This made me so confident in choosing to go with him as I knew he had the exact same vision as me. Abigail (PC) and Kris (Nurse) at the Liverpool clinic were amazing I can?��t stress enough how much they made my experience for me.

I would however warn others that if your thinking about an overnight stay at the Birmingham private hospital I would think again unless you don't want any sleep at all after the overnight cost has been added to your total bill. I was left hooked up to a beeping machine for 2 hours before getting up myself to figure out how to turn it off after coming out of surgery, there is a loud draught coming through the Windows, the doors won't close and open on their own making me jump which hurts, and the power has gone off and on all night on this ward then every machine beeps LOUD for ages to turn back on...then the power goes again! safe to say it's now 4:40am and I'm itching to get dressed and get home for well needed rest.

My personal co-ordinator Jade instantly made me feel at ease and she was amazing through the entire process. All the worries I had were again squashed when I met my surgeon Mr Simone, who again, instantly made me feel that I was 100% making the right decision for myself. His recommendation on my implants/size etc and actually taking my pettiness and the fact I weight train regularly and everything into consideration rather than just offering me the biggest implants there?��s is and sending me off to surgery (which when you?��re caught up in the excitement and prospect of big new boobs would be hard for a young girl to turn down) is when I knew he was the perfect choice. Jade could see how much it meant to me and she made it possible for me to be in and out of surgery within a few weeks of first meeting her and has checked up on me constantly throughout. She has literally made my dreams come true and Mr Simone has changed my life! They are more than I could of ever asked for. The perfect size for my body and they looked amazing from the second I came out of theatre. Some of my family and friends who were sceptical, were all won over and couldn?��t believe how natural and perfect they looked.

Turns out Mr. Khodaei had quit a couple weeks after operating on me and a few others, at first I was promised he would still have to review his patients (which was something I was desperate for as I already hated my new nose!) as time went on it was apparent this wasn't the case. He'd just quit, left and didn't have the courtesy to even bother reviewing his patients... so it doesn't surprise me ""9 out of 10 of his patients have needed revision surgery"" (quoted from one of the theatre nurses at the transform pines hospital). So I had my first op in April last year and didn't get my ""6 week post op review"" until December!! and i had to travel all the way to Manchester for all my consultations, when the clinic I'd originally agreed to use as a point of call for all appointments is 2 minutes away from me in Jesmond (Newcastle). Anyways my experience with transform this time round like I've said has been much better! My patient adviser at the jesmond clinic has been very apologetic about the situation and is easily contactable since, also making sure I've been reimbursed for travel expenses. And the nurses looking after me at the pines hospital in Manchester were very caring the second time round, I was quite ill after my op and I had a nurse coming in checking on me regularly, making sure I had everything I needed. And again Mr. Saeed has been world class! And so far I love the results of my revision! Just with my previous experience with Transform from this time last year the overall rating would have to be 3*, if I could go back I would definitely of done more research on surgeons! And only wish I found Mr. Saeed sooner!!",Positive,0.977,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Transform,expense,time,professional,0,research,0,0,results

Transform,direct,Jasmine,2018-02-11T09:05:09Z,5  stars,I couldn?��t be happier for choosing ?�?,I couldn?��t be happier for choosing transform as they really have changed my life for the better. I had a breast enlargement surgery and went from a 32A to a 32C. I wanted to go for a natural look and the surgeon I had specialised in creating natural looking breasts. I?��d wanted the surgery since I was 15 years old but was always told to wait and see if I developed more. The team at transform make you feel comfortable from the start of your journey to the end and I would highly recommend them. I am currently 3 weeks post Op and all things considered I?��m doing ok. Initially I had a bad reaction to the antibiotics and painkillers which I was given as they made me very sick and dizzy but once I came off them I was fine and just stuck to paracetamol for pain relief. I went for an over the muscle operation because I already had some breast tissue there and even though I?��ve still go lots of swelling I couldn?��t be  happier with the results so far. As for pain I wouldn?��t say there?��s been much it?��s more of a heavy and pressure feeling where you feel like you?��ve got someone sitting on your chest. I was able to drive in 2 weeks and returned to work after 8-9days. My nurse Becky is amazing and recommend a medication called Arnica 30 which helps reduce swelling and bruising after an op. You take it 1 week before surgery and 2 weeks after and Surprisingly I only had a 10p sign bruise on my right rib and that?��s it which I was really pleased with. I got it from Boots and it was about �4ish and there they are like tiny sugar pills which you crunch and not to bad at all. The team at the Riverside Hospital in Brentford London were very welcoming and caring. From arriving at the hospital you are greeted by the receptionist who then passes you over to your nurse who then shows you to your room. I had an overnight stay included with my surgery and was very happy with what was provided. You were given a choice of what to have for lunch and dinner on the day of your op and then breakfast the following morning.  My anesthestist was fantastic as it had in my notes I was scared of needles so they gave me a couple of options to make it easier for me to go to sleep for the op but In the end he done the canular in the back of the hand and a I barely felt it he was very quick and efficient. I even had a lovely Romanian lady who let me hold her hand while I fell asleep as no op is never not scary. The nurses came and checked me throughout the night making sure my blood pressure and temperature was all normal and also to look for any possible signs of infection. I?��ve got my 7 week check up appt in about 4 weeks and once I reach that I?��ll be considered all healed and I can start bra and bikini shopping. It?��s a great feeling having breast enlargement surgery and I?��m so glad I went ahead with it and would 100% recommend Transform without a shadow of a doubt.,Positive,0.9977,Breast Enlargement,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Transform,0,quick,lady,pain,0,0,happy,natural

Every appointment was a minimum of 30 mins late, a record of 80 minutes late. They scribbled 8am on a piece of paper and told me that was the time to be at the hospital, I phoned to double check this to be told ?��yeah If that?��s what written must be right?��. On the way to the hospital I got a phone call saying I had missed my check in time, as I was on track to be ?��early for my 8am?�� they waited for me - not the stress you want before going under the knife. The paper trail is rubbish and getting information is very hard, no one answers the phone 80% of the time.

There was also  a lovely Polish care assistant in the theatre who held my hand and kept me talking until I went to sleep.  I should have been a day case but Ms Lutz wanted to keep me in overnight to keep an eye on my bp (normal as soon as the anxiety had gone).

I am beyond upset with this. I do not have �2,000 to have my right breast fixed!

It was one little comment that made me so self conscious. After searching years for the perfect surgeon or debating whether to get it done at all I found Transform. From the first phone call I new I made the right decision. I met with my co-ordinator Emily who was so bubbly and very easy to talk too. I left feeling emotional as I never thought I could get it done. I had my consultation with Mr Maleagros who is undoubtably the most talented man I have ever encountered. We spoke about sizes and chose the right one for my shape. My biggest issue was them looking ?��fake?ѝ which on me I knew I would like. The day of surgery was the most surreal day. The whole run up to the operation I was petrified (more due to anaesthetic). When I got to Riverside it was like a hotel!!!how was this a Hospital. From the second I got there all my nerves disappeared,I was the most relaxed on the day of the operation than the whole run up. Before I went into surgery I had a quick consultation and draw ups and could ask my surgeon anything in this time. I went up to have my operation and my cheeks were hurting as the nurses were making me giggle so much, they held my hand through the whole procedure.i woke up and just burst into tears (for at least 20minutes) I just felt so happy! I just couldn?��t stop. From the second I woke up to now (5 weeks post op) I have not had one single bit of pain!like nothing!!!no discomfort, no aches, nothing! Even my nurse called me to make sure I was ok during the first week. I don?��t even feel like I?��ve had an operation it just feels like they have always been a part of me. Thanks to Transform, I feel like a woman. I have honestly never felt this happy in my life. I can?��t thank this company enough! I have recommended them to everyone! The results are even better than expected they just look so natural and even feel that way. My whole experience has been nothing but positives.

Got it done through Glasgow clinic. They still looked saggy after op. When bandages came off I could see no change.  Complained and was fobbed off. 1st surgeon unfortunately died so I saw a Martin Webster who was most insulting and told me I would be better off if I had spent money on tummy tuck. Next lady told me they should never have put them in and done only a lift. Gave up complaining  and just put it to back of my mind. But I've never been able to go topless . They are quick to take cash.  They have left me so unhappy for 17 years . Too late now but don't go near them.

I have had filler before where the results where brilliant...this was the most awful experience I was left so bruised and anxious I couldn't sleep for days.When I complained a week later and sent in pictures on email I was asked to come back to the clinic and the useless practioner numbed my lips popped the filler pockets and squeezed out the filler with her fingers leaving me with eyes watering and almost screaming in agony she also refused to remove the bad job she had done using hylase saying I was sensitive and needed to wait a few weeks for swelling to go down. She completely was rude and said "" I shouldn't worry, not as bad a plane falling out of sky or a terrorist attack."" When she finished this she escorted me out of the clinic and I felt that she could not get rid of me quick enough. I was left shocked and disgusted with her attitude. Again her attempt to pop and squeeze filler left me with further bruising and swelling for another week. A few weeks on I have a white ulcer on the top lip as well as uneven lumpy lips and the filler spots she had tried to pop are also still there.

Transform,direct,Gemma,2017-04-26T12:57:24Z,1  stars,NEVER GO WITH TRANSFORM,"I had rhinoplasty surgery with Transform back in February 2017 after being recommended by a friend. My whole experience with Transform was traumatic and i would most definitely not recommend them to anyone, not my friend or my worst enemy. The pre op appointments were fine and my pre op appointment with my surgeon Dr Lahoud was fine. I was excited to have the surgery done. It wasn't until i actually arrived at the riverside hospital that i experienced rude staff and lack of care and communication. The anesthetist was very nice and the staff in the surgery room however, i was appalled at my after care. I had the packaging TORN out my nose by a nurse, told i had to leave my room by 8am after being discharged, although i was waiting for my parents to collect me. I also asked multiple questions which weren't answered clearly, i even had to ask the receptionist on my way out, whether i could clean my nose or not. She replied, 'no you can't' and then a nurse came out to the reception and told me i could clean it , to which the receptionist then told me she was not a doctor and i should to listen to the nurse. Once at home, i had a few issues and my mother tried ringing the 24 hour EMERGENCY line, to which no one answered. We were put through to another line, and no one answered. After my traumatic experience my mum decided to come to the clinic in Southampton when i was going to get the splint removed. When we went up to the clinic, all staff agreed that the packaging should never have been torn out. My mum also wasn't allowed in the clinic room to accompany me when getting the splint removed, because of 'health and safety' despite informing her of my experience at the hospital. Annie, the nurse, was quite rude afterwards and made me feel very awkward. Before taking off my splint i did apologise for my mother as she was quite irate about not being allowed in with me. I wrote a letter of complaint to the hospital, to which they responded with a letter saying that as i apologised for my mother's behavior, i clearly thought what she was saying was incorrect, however that is obviously not the case. I tried calling the head office at the Pines hospital, and found that the receptionist was also very rude and abrupt and told me there was no one i could talk to about my complaint or any other matter. Overall, i would not recommend Transform to anyone. The way they treat their customers after taking their money, is diabolical.",Positive,0.1726,Rhinoplasty,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Transform,,wait,staff,0,0,clean,0,0

After my first surgery which was a supposed lift and implants I was left with breasts that sat lower than they did before surgery at all. And spoken down to when I was upset at results simply to be told if I'd explained to my surgeon dr tskecourus what I wanted he wouldn't of operated on me as it's not possible. Yet I thought that's what a consultation was for ? Absolute money robbers no concern or regard for patients once they have the money aftercare next to nil avoid at all costs. I'm now two surgeries in still in constant pain and living a day to day nightmare which I've paid close to 7k for.

It was coming up to my wedding and I thought this is the time it's now or never. Someone I knew recommended transform so I booked a consultation. From then on it was great I liked the girls and felt like it was a busy friendly place. I liked the surgeon mr widdowson when I met him there was no messing about and was very honest with me about the pros and cons of the treatment and all medical factors. I paid my deposit there and then and had my surgery done just a couple of weeks later. I went to the Edinburgh clinic and the place was spotless and everyone really friendly. It was all over quickly and I was back home recovering. I am looking forward to going back to mr widdowson to show him the results but for me everything has went even better than I could have expected and I love the result.

However, other elements of Transform experience weren't so good.  Reception staff at the Riverside hospital in Brentford were rude, indiscreet and made me feel uncomfortable.  I had two patient care co-ordinators both very young.  One messed up an initial consultation booking and later gave me wrong information about operation availability.  Both made me feel like i was on a conveyor belt.   The nurses (and indeed all medical staff) at the hospital whilst having my op were fantastic - I can't fault them.  I was also pleasantly surprised at how nice the room was and how great the food was - yum!  One criticism would be lack of information from transform about aftercare, such as how to look after stitches, nasal douching for congestion, icing etc - i wasn't given any info on this and got it from other rhino patients blogs which has been invaluable in helping my recovery.  Overall I would recommend Transform for rhinoplasty simply for Mr Lahoud but I probably wouldn't recommend them beyond this.",Positive,0.8973,Rhinoplasty,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Transform,0,0,staff,recovery,0,0,0,0

Transform,direct,Clare S,2016-07-28T13:44:55Z,3  stars,"Great Staff, not really the right treatment","My experience with Transform was a good one, despite my initial consultation meeting starting with a very disgruntled customer who was actively telling people to leave because all will be well until they have your money & then it goes downhill. I almost did consider leaving but was happy to make my own decision. The consultation was great, very polite, options discussed, long and short term and there was no pressure to purchase anything, though I knew exactly what I wanted so was happy to make arrangements there and then and stick to my own requirements, although other options were given.  My treatment, which was just 3 face peels began weeks later, my experience with the lady doing my treatments (Emma) was excellent, she is amazing, such a polite, caring and knowledgable person who i instantly connected with.  The way in which she did the treatments were fantastic but unfortunately it became clear after my first two sessions I wasn't getting any reaction or results/side effects, anything from the treatments which was very disappointing but no fault at all of the lady doing them. I think in the end it turned out that the treatment that was recommended in the consultation just simply wasn't what I had wanted/expected but I hadn't been aware of that until I started and just wasn't getting the results.  After my 3rd and last treatment I had some light shedding but as I am getting married in a few months time I had wanted something slightly more aggressive in the shorterm with some good results, to which I didn't get. Overall I was disappointed with the treatment as I feel I was very clear about my requirements up front and had to be trusting in the information supplied. I spoke with Emma who agreed that possibly different/stronger treatment was probably required to get the results I wanted and she was going to speak with the nurses to address this for me but by this time I had already spent �175 on treatments and didn't really want to start spending more when I felt like I had already wasted this up front so I decided to leave it.  I would wholeheartedly use and recommend anyone to have treatments with Emma but I likely wouldn't use Transform again as I feel that despite being very clear of what I wanted, the treatments recommended were not designed to cater for it. My appointments were always on time and the facilities were nice too, it wasn't a bad experience at all, was just disappointed I never got the results I had wanted/expected and felt I was very clear about this upfront.",Positive,0.9927,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Transform,0,time,person,0,0,0,happy,results

My story began when I started to notice my nipples getting bigger and where constantly very sore. I made an appointment to see my NHS GP, I told him about my Breasts, he checked them and told me just to take pain killers and not to worry about them so I thought ok. A few of my friends started to say 'your growing boobs' and at that point my self esteem was shattered. I stopped wearing tight 'T' shirts and started to wear oversized clothes. I looked hideous as I have an athletic body. Two years on my breasts got bigger and become painfull. The swelling became so bad that I used ice cubes on my nipples to allow the swelling to go down. I made another appointment to see my NHS GP, he then referred me to an NHS breast surgeon. He had a look and took a sample from my left nipple he sent the sample to be tested and said he will call me that day to give feed back, so stressed and worried I lost hope. The surgeon called and said nothing to worry about your just suffering from Gynaecomastia. I asked if he could remove it or give me medication to help the breasts to go down but he said it needs to be cut out but NHS have cut the funding but stated I'll try to put in a request.

Transform,direct,Kayleigh,2016-05-20T20:43:55Z,2  stars,Very poor aftercare,"Were brilliant when it came to booking me in for my pre op and consulatation with my surgeon and then my surgery. In my initial consultation the price was discussed and the additional insurance which I wanted, was told it was �150 and had that written down then at my consultation where I booked my op I was then told it was �200, you should of honoured the price I was told 3 weeks prior. Once I had my surgery went all down hill, I come round from my op and was sick 3 times so was given the anti sickness injection and it was directly in my muscle of my leg and made my leg dead for hours and hard to walk. Woke up the next morning and was released and allowed to go home, didn't have any courtesy call to see how I was getting on had to ring and ask if I could take my bandages off as they were bunching my skin up and causing it to crack and was really painful. Then went to my post op and was told my right incision was 2-3 days behind in heeling bearing in mind it was open with no stitches left at this point and was advised to keep it covered for 2-3 days then it will be fine. The following day it was really red, weeping, pussing and started to smell so called the Cardiff and Bristol clinics all day and left messages at both to have no reply!! Then rang the emergency 24 hour helpline to ask them and they advised me to go to A&E which is disgusting as I was a private paitent and hadn't been released from your care yet, she then passed on the message to Bristol and they rang me the next day and after speaking to every clinic you have they finally booked me in to see the nurse that day. So driving to Bristol again I was told that it was delayed healing and may be infected so took a swab and sent it off was bandaged up and sent on my way for another week. Returning the next week I was told it was infected and I needed an anti biotic prescription from London to then pick up from my local pharmacy which I then had to pay �5 for!! And to return weekly until they notice it's heeling so now returned this week for my 8 week post op where the nurse told me to take the bandage off for her to have a look so I led on the bed for her to have a look then she took my post op pictures and then sat at the desk to book my appointment with the surgeon leaving me to bandage it again myself and her telling me keep it covered until it's closed properly again. We also discussed the fact that I haven't got a patient co ordinator and I haven't from the start, who I should of been able to call if I had any problems. Following visits with the nurses where I was told to keep it clean and covered with the bandages etc they had used, they sent me away with just the 1 bandage for the week and none of the additional things to keep it clean and help it heal. So having to provide my own when I am allergic to most dressings from the high street. I am very unhappy with the post operative service I have received from yourselves and will not be recommending you to anyone!!",Negative,-0.97,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,price,time,service,painful,0,clean,happy,0

The Wellness Clinic,Target,Kevin G,2018-05-01T09:06:06Z,5  stars,Hair Transplant Dr Thomy Kouremada-Zioga,"Dr Thomy Kouremada-Zioga and her team were absolutely amazing. I researched extensively to find a hair transplant surgeon with such a large number of excellent independent reviews from clients. She was realistic about what could be achieved and stressed that hair loss will require lifelong attention with treatments such as Minoxidil, correct shampoos and nutrition. It can be depressing when she shows the extent of your hair loss. When you have spent years trying to conceal a problem to others and yourself. But I understood that she wanted to manage expectations of whats possible in each case and keep an eye on leaving some reserve of donor hair for future use. She is a perfectionist, a fantastic quality to have for a hair transplant surgeon. More importantly she is very highly skilled and her results are completely natural. The internet is full of examples of bad hair transplants and you only get one chance at it. You could risk going abroad or a cheaper transplant surgeon here, and ending up looking worse and destroying any self confidence you have left. I would not take that risk with something so important. The treatments, I had 2, front/top and then crown a year later. The density available wasn`t the highest from the donor area and extent of balding I had. But my hair looks amazingly full and my hairline is better than it ever was before. Even as a child I had very high temple hair lines that did not suit me and I always covered up with longer hair. That became Increasingly impossible from the ages of 28-41, my hair loss probably exacerbated by the stress from sadly losing my wife to a terminal disease requiring me to care for her over 6 years, our 3 children and keep a full time job. During that time I didn`t obviously have any concern about how I looked or If I was losing my hair. After losing my wife, grieving and having a very low self confidence I knew I had to do something, at least about my confidence. Many men reading this who have tried to hide there hair loss with their hairstyle will know that this simply limits what you do in life. You wont go out in bad weather or do activities that affect your hair and it gets ridiculous. So I was at the point that so many men get to, shave it short or find a solution. For me a transplant was the only solution and the results are amazing and entirely natural looking. Dr Zioga has given me back my confidence, I can see people noticed something but were not always sure what. Lots of comments about how I look younger though. I told my family and friends, the stigma about having such a procedure seems to be mostly gone now. The treatment is very expensive if you need a large area transplanted, in my case for 2 treatments (2 days each). But it is honestly the best money I have every spent on myself and would not hesitate for one second to have it done again. I am now 43 and feel a second lease of life, I can not stress enough how happy I am with Dr Zioga and her team. If you are considering this treatment I would book your appointment with her now.

It's not always a case of staff & how well your treatment worked out. This clinic in Leeds was just a short walk from the train station. This put me off Bridgwater in Manchester.

The Wellness Clinic,Target,Emma Rowland,2017-12-16T07:57:29Z,2  stars,Liposuction,"Well where do I start, I have always hated my knees and never wanted to show them as I have fat tissue around my knee area and no matter how much exercise or dieting i do, I have been told by numorus fitness instructors that I will never remove the fat in this area as its a stubborn area to remove. So because I never felt confident about my legs and of always disliked them I decided to look up and do my research on liposuction, now I knew that I would never get thin legs and I know liposuction is more of a body sculpting that a drastic change but I thought if this operation would may my legs look better than it was w orth the expense. So before making my decision on finding the right clinic and surgeon I saw a few surgeons and they all said slightly different things and also the prices ranged from �3000-�6000 which I thought was quite a big jump. The first surgeon I saw said he would only recommend getting my knee area rather than my thigh as he said I wouldn't see much result by getting both areas done as I explained that my problem area was my knee and I just wanted to look in the mirror and feel like I can show my legs off because my knees looked more like everyone else's. He quoted me of a fee of �3000 which I thought sounded reasonable I also mentioned to him that I had seen another surgeon who mentioned that the reasons for my knees been like How they was because I had a condition called lipedema, the surgeon said he didn't think I had and asked if they were genetic which I said yes my mum has got the same knees. Then I had a consultation with DR Wolf at The Wellness Clinic in Bi rmingham, I had read up about this surgeon I had also seen him on YouTube and the fact he also worked in London I assumed he must be really good at his job. DR Wolf said I had the condition lipedema and I never heard of this condition before he explained not many doctors no the history on the condition and recommended that I should have the thigh and the knee done because if I just have the knee area done then I would have an in proportion leg as my knee would be smaller but my thigh wouldn't look right and the cost for both areas was �5800. But because Dr Wolf had said he had done another lady's leg who had the same condition it made me feel at ease that i would get the best results from him even though it was more money. After going away and thinking about it, I had made my decision that Dr Wolf was the surgeon I would like to carry out my operation and I had Also read the really good reviews at The Wellness Clinic. I thought that he was the right choice to get the best r esults from and in my head because I was paying more this also made me think I would get better results. After calling the clinic to arrange my appointment, well from then it just went from bad to worse the service from the staff was so unprofessional when you are paying a lot of money you would expect you would get really good service, first of all it was all rush rush to get the payment. Well time when by and i received a call from a nurse who explained she needed to ask me a few questions as my op was in 3 days. She asked me if I had been taking a course of antibiotics that I should have received to reduce blood clots before the operation, I didn't know anything about any antibiotics that i needed to take I wasn't told or given any she also asked me if I had any alcohol in last 2 weeks luicky i hadn't, then I questioned the nurse and said why are you asking me this 3 days before she I not had been told before this, she replied did you not receive you pack about the operat ion and what you need to do before. I said no I have received nothing! At this point I was disgusted that I was terrified as it is that I was going to have an operation and to be told I should have had a course of antibiotics and I also said what if I had alcohol what if I had been on the sunbed, would I still be able to go ahead with the op because of your error that I have received the right information. I was so angry at this point and scared that it could increase me getting blood clots because I had not taken these antibiotics. The day of surgeory the surgeon said have you taken the course of antibiotics I replied no I wasn't given any, is this going to effect me? He kinda said okay no it should be fine. So I had my op done the lady on reception said that she would call me the next day to arrange my next appointment with the nurse. But 2 days passed heard nothing so I had to chase my own check up appointment when I called and told her I was annoyed about the situation her words was she's on her own and it's been busy. I thought that's not my problem if you under staffed. She also told me to shower my legs the day after surgery and I wasn't sure if my legs should have been wet so soon after as I had open wombs. I they got worried and called the nurse she said I should have got my legs and bandages wet so soon after my op, so again been told the wrong thing about the staff. I then had a few after care appointments with the nurse and then Dr Wolf, he said he was happy with the result and he asked my opinion and I said to be honest I don't feel like they look much differnt my thigh looks thinner but my knee looks the same, he replied well we can't get in around the knee area because of the bone, I felt like saying well you didn't say that st the beginning so I basically thought the reason why he said I should have my thigh done Also is because he knew I wouldn't get any results from just having the knee area done. I also said can I see the ph otos you took before so I can see the difference and he changed the subject and wouldn't send them me! So he knew the liposuction hasn't made any differnce to my knee area, he then said that to see a change in my knee I would need a thigh lift, so he was then tryna to sell me that.Such a rip off be warned before you decide to go here such a poor service and not much change to my legs, worst experience I have ever had!

Unfortunately they didn?��t seem to know what they were doing and finding myself telling them how to do their job left me lacking confidence in the company but actually I think in retrospect this was the individual and perhaps a training gap rather than a reflection on the company and the key people that count ie the surgeon and their operative team. Also the company tried to charge a 2.5% credit card surcharge on two separate occasions which I refused to pay having reminded them it is actually illegal to do this now. The most they can charge is 0.5% and from Jan 2018 it is 0%.

The results from that were never as I would have liked and since then, unfortunately, I had put a bit of weight on around my flanks. Even after a few years of going to the gym the flank area just did not budge, so I had been considering Lipo again. However, due to my previous experience I was reluctant to spend the money in case I was not fully satisfied again. Then, earlier this year I came across some articles on Vaser Lipo and the type of results it could achieve so I decided to bite the bullet and give it a go. Well... I wish I had read that article a lot earlier. The results, even now after only a few weeks, are a world away from my previous treatment.

The Wellness Clinic,Target,Madelaine Lazaga,2017-08-04T08:02:31Z,5  stars,Excellent 5 star service from the day I walked into the Manchester clinic,"I had been suffering from chest pains a few months ago and found out that my implant had ruptured. I had originally had my implants done in the Philippines just over 4 years ago by one of the best surgeons in the Philippines. I did some research and found The Wellness Clinic in Manchester. From the first phone call and the first time I stepped in the clinic, the service was nothing but first class. I was treated with respect and everyone was so welcoming. When I saw my surgeon Mr Oudit, he reassured me that the problem could be fixed as he was an expert in doing surgeries like this. I felt so comfortable with him, he did not make me feel nervous at all and made me feel like I was in the right hands from the start. Mr Oudit suggested that I had an uplift, removal of old implants and clean and replace implants to fix the problems I was having. The pain started to get really bad and they managed to move my surgery 5 weeks earlier, which was amazing. The team in Manchester really pushed for it so that I could be put out of my misery and pain. Since the pain was so bad during my first surgery I was convinced that the pain would be so much worse, but in fact the pain was actually nowhere near as bad as when I had them originally done. This is testimony that Mr Oudit put so much care into my surgery. It has only been 6 days since my surgery and I am healing a lot better and faster than anticipated. The aftercare has been amazing, the clinic nurse even managed to fit me in before my first official appointment to ease my mind and make sure no infection has developed. Mr Oudit is the best surgeon who I would recommend over and over again to anyone. He really has taken care of me and provided first class 5 star service. From what I can see, my breast are absolutely amazing and I never thought they would look and feel the way they do. This has surpassed my expectations. My patient coordinator Alex is the best in the business. He always answered all my calls and eased my worries when I really needed him and answer any questions I had. He rang around finding me the hospital at last minute and making sure my surgeon could perform the surgery. Cheryl, the clinic manager moved my appointment earlier and made sure I was priority. She also answered any questions I had prior to the surgery and made me feel less nervous about the procedures I was having. Andrew, the clinic's nurse has been amazing pre and post-op, providing me with information and making sure I was healthy with no complications after the surgery. Reception staff (Rhiain and Sarah), always friendly voices at the end of the phone and whenever I was in the clinic. If I could give this clinic more than 5 stars I definitely would. I can't wait to be fully healed and see the final result. Thank you so much Manchester team, you have done an amazing job and I am sure you will continue to do so. Nothing less than 5 stars for you all.",Positive,0.9958,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,The Wellness Clinic,0,time,staff,pain,research,clean,thank you,0

The Wellness Clinic,Target,Steve Anon,2016-12-24T22:31:46Z,5  stars,Incerdible service at Leeds,"I have been attending The Wellness Clinic in Leeds since January, and have since undergone several different treatments. My first of which was a revision of my previous plug hair transplant treatment from many years ago. My aim was to soften my very harsh hairline which I was quite conscious of. Before arranging my appointment with TPC I had visited many reputable clinics across the Country and had not felt comfortable with proceeding to the next stage. For me, it has to feel right. My initial consultation with The Wellness Clinic was with Sorena, who made me feel at ease and went through in detail what I wanted to achieve. Sorena was very thorough and asked many questions, to find out what I was expecting from the treatments, a professional lady who conducts herself well. I was never made to feel pressured into going ahead and was looking forward to meeting with Dr Tam as I didn't think there were many surgeons who could improve my previous plug hairline. My meeting with Dr Tam went very well and again he was very thorough and honest. He took my points into consideration. Dr Tam understood the reasons I was contemplating the treatment and after the assessment I was looking forward to booking in. He was very receptive to my needs and made me feel comfortable. On the day of treatment I was greeted with a warm welcome and the day went better than I had expected. Dr Tam's surgical team made me feel at ease and I was very well looked after. Since my FUE treatment I have had other procedures with Dr Vlok and his team and again extremely happy with results. The clinic is very clean and Sorena and her team have made me feel welcome each time I have attended. The communication pre and post surgery has always been prompt. I would highly recommend Sorena and the team of skilled Doctors in Leeds who have definitely changed my life and would refer my friends and family. I am assured that they would have the same experience I have. Thank you also to the bookings team who again were again very knowledgable and steered me in the right direction.

I also wanted the procedure as quickly as possible but without compromising on the quality. From the point I had first contact with this private clinic they were friendly and went out of their way to meet my needs and got everything done in a time scale I wanted. I was given a choice of surgeons and chose Mr Ken Kok. Mr Kok was excellent at making sure he fully understood everything I wanted and making sure I understood fully the whole procedure and any possible problems that could occur, i had the chance at any point to question him directly in regards to any concerns I had. At one point I was concerned about the size we had agreed on and he invited me back to the clinic to try sizing and talk through the concerns I had which made me feel comfortable and relaxed about my choices. I also asked for a mole removal off my face which they had no problem adding to the procedure. I had the procedure within a month of my first contact with the clinic; I also used their finance scheme which was easy to apply for. Post op I am more than happy with the results that look natural and Mr Kok made everything the way we had agreed and he is very professional, easy to approach person and shows compassion for you as a client and a personal interest in a good recovery; the staff at the clinic had the same approach, the anaesthetist discussed my pain control options and reassured me their aim was to try and make this as pain free as possible . The after care has been brilliant and I felt in safe hands throughout.

Yes I'm still in the swollen recovery stage and looking a little lumpy but the difference is amazing and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend going for it . My consultation in Harley Street with Dr Wolf was swift but not rushed with plenty of opportunity to ask questions.  Following that I was  taken through to the lovely Lisha who gave me the cost of the procedure and then went on to explain how things would proceed.  I made my decision immediately but didn't have to,  I just knew it was what I wanted , even though I was extremely nervous! I paid my deposit and from then on things moved quickly with emails, prescriptions and clear instructions for both pre and post op. My actual procedure took place in Knightbridge and not Harley Street with 4 professionals in attendance who all made me feel at ease. I can't say what the actual lipo felt like as my sedation was amazing and I was out for the count and didn't feel a thing!  Seeing my 'cocktail' of liquified fat was actually  quite emotional and I had a few tears of pure joy.. probably just the sedation affecting me but I was extremely happy that things had gone so well. During the 1st few days there is leakage from the drainage tubes and the area is a little sore but after 5 days the tubes are removed and healing is quite quick. Over the last 2 weeks I have had the recommended MLD to help with the swelling and lumps that happen due to the invasive procedure and continued wearing the compression garment but other than the obvious sensitivity to my skin I feel pretty good. My scars are next to nothing and I'm looking forward to seeing the full results which can take 4-6 months but already wearing cloths more confidently and that's what it's all about.  This decision has given me much more than a flat belly for sure. My one negative comment would be that I expected the place in Knightsbridge where the procedure took place to be as luxurious as Harley Street but it isn't at all!  I believe new premises are being sought so hopefully some thought will be given to the decor and the feel of being a private patient paying substantial fees,  hence my deduction of 1 star.   However it wouldn't stop me recommending The Wellness Clinic as I feel the whole package is worth every penny and I am extremely happy",Positive,0.9973,0,ASER Lipo,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,The Wellness Clinic,cost,quick,professional,recovery,0,0,happy,results

I am so very happy after so many years of wanting this procedure that I came across Dr Karoo at the Bristol clinic. I had a couple of meetings with him (and a nurse), to talk about all the expectations of this procedure and what it entails etc. He listened to me and then made recommendations as how to achieve my goal (within my personal limitations).

They certainly weren't an organisation who would do anything for the money, they invested time and effort to ensure that not only was this in my best interests but that I was certain it was what I wanted. This means that The Wellness Clinic value their patients you aren't simply a pay cheque, they want to make sure that this is right for you and ethically the right thing to do. Their focus may be on results but that is because they want you to get the best result for you. In a word it's about you.

My body however would be the only thing to send me backwards, I felt at home at the clinic I never once felt judged and they completely understood how I felt. I wanted to avoid dieting again and after the years of battling with weight my surgery was seen to be a preventative to heading down that path again. This decision however was not taken lightly, the wonderful Dr wolf ensued that he contacted many specialist psychologists within the eating disorder field and my own psychologist to ensure that the procedure would help. He took time to get to know me and has made sure that within my follow up I have support and close contact with him. He was an amazing surgeon and is understanding always wanting to give you time and his true opinion. You as a patient feel valued and understood.

All promises made to me about a faint 6 pack and some definition and fat removal did not happen and i saw very little change in-fact the changes i saw would have taken me only 4 weeks to achieve on a diet! I kept getting advised to wait for six months to see the results but i didn't believe them and after six months it still looked the same! just as i had expected. I had wasted a whole year and now have to get it done all over again by a different clinic! I paid �8k for my treatment and it was a total waste of money and that doesn't include train journeys to London and loss of earnings and pain and anxiety.

I wont mention names. Both doctors I talked to where very nice and I was confident I was going for the best option. The day of the surgery I was made to seat out front for a full two hours waiting,after I arrived on time. Finally when the surgeon came through I got changed and he quickly drew on with the marker I told him my concerns and he told me all will be taken care of. Everything seemed so rushed for such a body altering procedure.I went into the surgery room and some time later I was woken up. Literally made to stand on my own without much support I was so dizzy I almost fell over from the sedation but I guess they had to have another patient in ASAP,so I had to be taken off the surgery bed,the vaser fluid was going everywhere even after changing into the compression garment.I felt like a barnyard animal,not a human in a hospital after surgery. You would think after paying 13000 GBP cheap cotton would be available ! They literally wanted me out. After checking my pressure and my shoes soaked with blood running from the different holes in my body,I waited another 45 mins for a prescription. By this time I was close to tears sitting alone in the after surgery room,no nurse checking if youre fine or need anything. As if that is not enough, 7 months later the final shape was irregular flanks,deformed buttocks,one thigh bigger than the other in a very obvious way,scars,my inner thigh more obvious than ever as the surgeon was to much of in a hurry to get the next patient,so why bother with the complicated parts of the surgery,I had ALL the inner thigh fat intact,he didnt even try ! I HAD NO follow up what so ever,only emails advertising more treatments ! Frankly I do not need or even want an apology or explanation because I will never go back to that clinic again,but just shared to help another girl that worked hard for her to finally have a procedure,so they can make an informed choice. I have been so depressed,I feel like I was robbed of not only money but a year of my life as I just didnt feel good about myself. I have had to spend another 10 000GBP to get a revision this month and already have some  of my spark back.

To be quite honest, I felt like it was my last chance where I could get help. I had a very bad problem with my acne - they were very severe.

I was warned that I will get more acne when I first start using the products which was scaring me as I already had severe acne. When I first started using the products, I did get more acne but they weren't as bad as I thought. Finally, I had 3 n-lite treatments which I was so pleased with. However, in addition to n-lite and skin products, I've been taking erythromicin antibiotics for 6 months. It's been a long time but I am so happy that I didn't give up and carried on doing everything as I was told. Now, I still have a few spots and some scars but my face definitely doesn't look as bad as it used to and I am very pleased with the results. I've became a lot more confident and honestly I wasn't expecting to have such great results.

Then at 40 the middle thins and panic sets in. Can't hide it any more. It's time to go for the transplant but where do I go, will it work, do I want to spend a ridiculous amount of money in the hope it might bring back my diminishing confidence and make me resemble the boy/man I once was. Well I had my op a year ago today and I'm a changed man. But let's back track. I researched for two or three years prior. I tried a few places but Lisa from The Wellness Clinic was empathetic, had anecdotes to share and managed my expectations fantastically. Then I met Dr Zioga. I had lost a lot of hair. She suggested moving about 5000 from back to front, so I eventually agreed. I had to try something. Couldn't look in the mirror anymore. It's only my life saving's right? So I went for it. Did it hurt? Yes, now and then when the injections went in to numb the area. Did it traumatise me afterwards when I looked at 5000 holes in the back of my head, 5000 red dots at the front, bald sides and a few sprigs of hair on top. Yes! For two weeks, then things started to change. A month went by and I could start using products and get back to making it look almost presentable. And to cut this long story short, each month my hair improved, my hair style improved, my confidence improved. I feel 90% more confident in my appearance now. No more stressing when looking in the mirror. Believe me it's changed my life. Was it worth the money. Yes! I get the hair my wife gets the car. Fair deal! But let's be honest, it's not what it was when I was 20 and if you shine a light on it it can look thin, but the fact I don't walk around the place with a light on my head means it looks great! Dr Zioga really is the business. Her team are wonderful. If you've thought about having it done, get their advice and do it here.

The Wellness Clinic,Target,Sarah Remon,2015-03-13T14:51:50Z,1  stars,Pixel laser Dr Gupta and Private Clinic London,First of all I'll start by telling you I saved for 3 years just to go to this clinic and see this man as had seen him on TV and presumed I would receive best possible treatment here! After treatment I was given ridiculous after care advice and regretably followed it as he was the expert! I was advised to wash my face every 2 hours with what ever face wash I normally use for the next few days until all the dead skin had came off. When I asked don't I need to keep area moist etc as I had done research before treatment that seamed to imply this. I was told well you could put a little moisturiser on if you want to its up to you. So I said but which is best? he said the drier the better! so I said best not to then he said yes! At this point I also asked as the moisturiser I use has retinol in is that okay to use  he said yes that's fine! His own assistant had to correct him and then he said oh okay yes leave it about 3 days until you use that. I then developed dermatitis under my eye area from washing so much my skin was healing terribly I kept ringing to check I should really be washing my face this much and was told yes drier the better. On the next treatment when I explained about how long skin took to heal and dryness etc he said maybe just wash every 4-6 hours then. While I stood there with my freshly pixeled skin his assistant was already spraying air freshner in the air ready for there next patient. I Phoned concerned as Dr gupta had gone very close to my eye with laser and I now had broken veins under one eye! and skin appeared very thin dark and creppy. He spoke briefly with me and said that's fine don't worry I have a laser for that I can just zap that away book a follow appointment with me and we'll sort it. So I did! I turned up to be greeted as though he hadn't told me to book appointment etc he was like hello what are we doing for you  today. So when I said you told me to book appointment  with you to zap vein under eye.  He said unless you want to loose your eye sight I can't treat near your eye with those lasers.I had already spoken with him on the phone and he knew it was under eye area I was concerned with! So not only was I humiliated and spoke to rudely I had just traveled 124 miles to appointment as he had said yes book appointment I can zap that no problem. When I mentioned how concerned I was with under eye area now seaming so thin and dark. He said it will appear darker the pixel removes layers of skin!!! I went there for scar revision not to be given eye bags. I now feel so self conscious as my eye area is now all thin creepy and dark when I smile it sinks in to my eye area. I used to feel confident about my eyes even though my skin was horrid now i have no confidence at all. When I complained as to how upset I felt I was told someone would ring me and they never did then I was going to get a letter?. then I'd be hearing from the manager and eventually all I got was an email saying my eye area was never treated!! talk about salt in wounds! and they are sorry to hear of my dissatisfaction. I have since called many times and been told the manager is either on lunch or on the phone and she will ring me back! NO ONE HAS EVER RUNG BACK!! I have since had to derma roll under my eye area on numerous occasions in hope of regaining thickness to under eye area. The only reason I can think of them telling me to wash my face obsessively like that is to guard there own back from any possible infection but it would most certainly not give best healing results which is so important to achieve results you want from this sort of treatment.

He was very open and honest with me about the procedure, the risks and results and all. He also explained to me that microcannular liposuction would be the best option as vaser would only take fat from one area. Completely different consultation experience compared to one I had had a week prior. I was not made to feel like the clinic just wanted my money, or was rushing me or was forcing me to do anything, in fact it was the complete opposite and Dr Gupta advised me to think about it. I had already made up my mind about having surgery before I walked in for my consultation it was just a case of where and who could give me the best service. I made my decision that I would chose The Wellness Clinic and Dr Gupta and contacted Kasia to go ahead with it. (Kasia was very helpful throughout and answered any questions I had, was so friendly and welcoming when I went to the clinic.) I had the procedure done at Brompton Road. The staff were calm and welcoming and again answered any questions I had. When I went in for my procedure there was two nurses as well as Dr Gupta. I felt a bit uncomfortable about it at first but one of the nurses was very talkative and for the most part of the surgery I didn't realise I was having surgery done because she took my mind off of it! The procedure seemed to go pretty quick and easy for me and before I knew it I was finished. The day after my surgery I had a missed call and a voice mail left from the clinic making sure I was okay and if I had any problems to call in. Around 6 weeks later I had a follow up appointment with Dr Gupta and he told me I can come back any time as he would like to see the progress.

Sk:n,wider industry competitor,Rachael Duffy,2019-03-07T23:58:09Z,5  stars,Wish I'd found Sk:n 10 years ago!,"I wouldn't hesitate for a minute to recommend Sk:n! I have an unusual case of acne scarring and for a decade was told the results may be mixed due to the abnormal scarring and location. It was also questionable how much time off work I would need and the cost was usually just an estimate. All the doubts left me living with something that has destroyed my self confidence and relationships. I almost accepted that it was never going to change until I saw the Lasercare branch of Sk:n at James Cook hospital. Sk:n being based within an NHS hospital immediately reassured me they would give the correct information so I made an appointment to see the dermatologist: I wasn't dissapointed!                                                                     After a few minutes consultation the Doctor asked me what my hopes were and confirmed that I had a realistic outcome. He confidently offered a treatment plan and said because I was travelling long distance he could start the treatment that day if I wanted. The reality then hit me that not only was this happening... but the pain I'd been previously been told about was also now reality! The procedure took about 5 to 10 minutes and hurt no more than someone lightly flickering their finger on your skin, even when on very sensitive/delicate skin. I was able to wear clothes immediately after and complete normal activity though my skin felt a bit 'sun burnt' for a few hours and I was very colourful for 2 weeks while the bruising healed but over all I am highly impressed! It certainly wasn't the 'no pain, no gain' I was expecting even with Sk:n's reassurance. The only thing I cant sing the praises of is the result... purely because I have at least 2 more treatments to go! What I can say is one treatment down I believe the scarring has faded up to 50% which is amazing! I hope to report it is barely visible/gone by the end of Summer!",Positive,0.6589,0,0,0,0,0,0,Acne,0,0,0,Sk:n,cost,time,care,pain,0,0,0,results

My son is having the final treatment with Leslie, who did the other two. Happy customer. Original review: I booked 3 treatments and various recommended products for my 17 year old son spending about �380. Treatments about �100 a time. The lady who did the initial consultation and first two treatments was absolutely lovely, she put him at ease (he even went by himself the second time). We had to leave 10 days minimum in between treatments. He was going on holiday Jan 28th and we needed to change the date of his second treatment. I phoned their contact centre, again a polite guy who tried his best to find ways of fitting us in before 28th January for final 2 treatments. It wasn?��t possible. He advised we keep Jan 20th (our original 3rd appointment) as is and rebook for the 3rd treatment on his return. Second treatment went great, his skin was looking clearer than ever. A really happy teen. Luke came back from hols, I phoned up and booked him in for 3rd and final treatment for the 14th Feb. And then it went horribly wrong. It was a different person who met us, not a problem for us, but then she said, so you?��re booked in for a review. No a treatment I corrected. Surprised she went back to reception to check. Came back into the room and said: ?��No, it?��s a review. You missed your appointment on the 26th January.?ѝ I told her we?��d never made an appointment for the 26th. In an aggressive tone which my son commented on immediately after we left she responded with ?��You were told that if you missed an appointment again you forfeit the treatment.?ѝ But I?��ve never missed an appointment before? I told her that my son couldn?��t possibly have had a treatment booked in for that day as their was a minimum number of days between treatments. Her response: ?��well those days are flexible?ѝ. There was no manager available and no one to escalate it to. I just couldn?��t believe her outright refusal to believe a word I was saying. Now my son said he?��d never go back, even though it was working and the first woman who did the treatments was absolutely lovely. I?��m gutted. His confidence in his appearance was really lifting. So no I cannot recommend a clinic whose default mode is to assume I?��m a liar and get aggressive with me.",Positive,0.5348,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,time,guy,0,0,0,happy,0

Sk:n,wider industry competitor,E Mackie,2019-02-20T13:42:34Z,2  stars,Disappointed with the consistency of care and results.,I had had a full course of laser treatment with a small company 3 years ago with no regrowth. I went to skn for top up sessions and was only offered a course of treatment (6 sessions). It really does depend who you get. There?��s no consistency and they certainly never took into consideration I had had a full course previously. They wanted me to come in every 4 weeks (but wouldn?��t do areas that had no regrowth in case of stimulating growth...Why come in every 4 weeks then if not to sell more sessions later down the track) and the setting levels they were using over those sessions slowly built up to a medium setting but the last two were back down to the first session I had. They?��ve offered me a review now that I?��ve finished which will probably sell me another course as the level of hair reduction is minimal. No comparison to the first course I had with a different company which was consistent and tailored to what I needed rather than a standard response from whoever I happened to get that week. Apparently I found out in my last appointment that I hadn?��t had a skin test after each session so couldn?��t get a higher setting...no one mentioned skin tests after each session once! I think they are more about making money than actually giving people lasting results. There was no reason that I should have been on the minimum by the time I finished except that no one coordinated my treatment or took anytime to actually think about what was needed. I?��m sure I will be offered another course of 6 if I do go for the review so will be looking elsewhere to see if I can get better results. Really disappointed and what feels like a waste of money 12 months on. I would say all the girls were perfectly pleasant and the first three sessions were done by the same person who was very good and did increase the setting but I saw a different person each time after that.,Positive,0.9552,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,time,person,0,0,0,0,results

I said I?��d like to know more about my skin type, the type of acne I have etc. She attempted to get out a machine to look at my skin which was in fact broken and she said they never use it.

She suggested we conduct the session and come in for a review once completed. The normal pre-clean and shave was extremely quick and she the progressed to use the laser. From the first zap it felt way different from previous sessions, which I explained (it felt like my face was burning). Her response was to increase the air blowing and continue. I stated a number of times it didn't feel the same but she continued. At the end of the session my face felt like someone had put a live flame on my neck.

Started the treatment and was really happy with the first results (even purchased a further package for another area). However, halfway through the treatment, I noticed there was no hair reduction in certain areas and pointed this out to the member of staff doing the procedure. Instead of enquiring into it, her reaction was rather defensive and I felt ridiculed to say at least. Pointed this out before each remaining session and nothing really happened. Except a free session because their laser stopped working. Fast forward, at the end of the treatment I still had a patch of hair in my nether areas, and another area which has not really responded to the treatment. At the end of treatment review (which they rescheduled with little notice), they rushed straight into discussing further treatments without even looking at the results. However, after I said I wasn?��t happy with the results, this concluded with an additional ?��free of charge?ѝ review with their dermatologist, who said that my hair did not respond to the treatment, and that further treatment wouldn?��t address the problem (I pointed this out halfway through the treatment, why did I have to pay and continue with it if it wasn?��t working???). They never actually checked how the hair responded during the treatment, as I had to shave before. No in between actual result reviews (they did ask me before each session what percentage of reduction I think I achieved). After the last apppointment with the doctor I was promised a call from the manager, which never happened. I know I am supposed to go in to maintain the (poor) results, but no one advised me of this, or the frequency of these sessions. So I basically paid the premium price for going to a ?��clinic?ѝ presumably staffed with medically trained people who know what they?��re doing - instead of a beauty place where I could have done it for a quarter of the price) - and can?��t help but wonder where is the premium in it?

The first time the experience was super painless and I was happy with the result, albeit Juvederm is not very good in my opinion, having tried Restylane and one more brand which both had better volume and longevity. So on this note, it would be good to provide more brand options. All the times I have done fillers, my only problem area has been the top lip. I always specify this, and the ideal outcome is to achieve a balance since my bottom lip is already very adequate. Sure, sometimes a pinch or two can be added in the middle to make it rounder, but nothing that would extend its size or go towards the bottom lips line! And so, at my second visit with the same doctor, although I have specified this as usual, he/she added some to the bottom, even around the line, and actually, on one side it is outside the actual lip itself and this is noticeable when i touch it or smile. This is extremely dissapointing not only because I specifically said i want all of it at the top, it is also a waste of the syringe which could be going to the top!!!  Completely threw off the balance I was after making the problem the same, just with overall bigger lips and also feeling ridiculously awkward and uncomfortable about my bottom lip...The Dr insisted that it ''would not look good'' if i added more to the top, but frankly i have injected more in the past where it was more affordable and those where the only times i got the desired results (and better products). There is also a habit of leaving a few ml in the syringe both times, again with the claim that there is no need to add more or there is no where else to put it etc, but when i am paying for a full syringe, i expect to use all of it... AND in the spots that i am actually seeking to add to! I will note that, the Dr did offer to dissolve the material in the bottom lip, but i was way more bruised the second time i went and had a very small window to go and dissolve it before moving abroad and already looked so beaten up. In addition, this would not really solve the wasted ml that have gone to the bottom lip. Surely the Dr is skilled, but an aesthetic opinion is something that only a client should appoint especially when it is discussed and verbalised both before and during. I wasn't after looking like a Kardashian by any means and also knowing the quality of Juvederm as opposed to the other brands I used, i knew exactly what i was after. But even if someone was looking to do something ''extreme'', as long as it is safe, i see no reason why a Dr should oppose that or decide where to inject while the patient is laying there with trust, not really able to speak up when a needle is cm away from your face... on a last note, the website could be way more clear/detailed and accurate about pricing and the service over the phone is equally clueless about advice/costs, only able to book/cancel appointments really.",Negative,-0.1635,0,0,0,0,Lip Fillers,0,Spots,0,0,0,0,cost,time,service,pain,website,0,happy,results

During my first free consultation, which was to know more about it and to ask any questions and for me to decide if I was going to have the treatment or not, I asked all I needed to ask, and was reassured by the person I saw who told me that if there was any problem or if I ever needed to stop for any reason, it was absolutely fine and that I would get a refund. I made the first payment to pay before you start the treatment (I was urged to do it as quickly as possible so we could start the treatment as quickly as possible). I paid on the same day and then applied for the finance plan. Omni capital accepted the finance plan and I had my very first session of laser hair removal 2 weeks later. After my first session, which I didn't fully completed because it was extremely painful and I ended up shaking like a leaf for over 40mins after the first 10mins of treatments, I had to tell the person to stop because I couldn't do any more. She was nice, friendly and understanding so I have nothing bad to say about her. She told me it was fine, to see how I'd fell and that I could just do what was left to be done next time.",Positive,0.6854,0,0,0,0,0,Laser Hair Removal,0,0,0,0,Sk:n,cost,quick,person,painful,0,0,0,0

As a trans woman, I've been treated with dignity and respect with regards to my gender and presentation, and the staff seem well versed in such issues. The rate of laser hair removal for me personally (dark hair on fairly light skin, so an ideal case) has been fair, slower than I'd hoped to get the results that I wanted on my face (about 21 sessions from start to just needing top-ups), but it's all well worth it in my opinion, Price is fair when they have a deal on (there's almost always between 30 and 60% off the RRP prices) and while it's certainly not ""cheap"", the results are well worth the price IMHO.

Then my appointment was changed twice and when I finally arrived, I was told there was no one to do the pro on me just the basic hydrafacial. I made a fuss considering I had been informed the reason  my appointment was changed the second time was because the specific adviser appointed to me was off sick. After a lot of toing and froing, I finally had someone to do the facial that was apparently qualified. So then the facial started, lo and behold, the laser machine refused to work, 20 minutes of tampering later, still not working sowe proceed with the hydrafacial basic which doesn't have much impact on the acne prone skin.

The consultation was a mere 5mins , 3mins of that him repeating questions already I had already answered on the form.  Then I asked if he could advise about thread veins in my leg.  He told that should be another appointment!!! Shocking.   Then when I asked for the costs, he advised the highest cost possible, �300-�400 per treatment, i.e.  to treat a few a tiny veins, �.  I expressed that this sounded incredibly high based on other quotes and took the form to have a look.  To my sheer surprise there was option for a nurse to perform the same procedure at HALF of the price.  He neglected to share that option.  Selling up in the biggest way.

After being a client for several years I trusted I would receive good results little did I know it would cause paradox growth which one of their doctors confirmed and told me it will settle by the new year however its is now June and still not settled! So to keep me quiet they offered me a PARTIAL refund of what I paid. No compensation or additional treatment to fix the area, even when staff said it could be treatable with a few sessions. I am now 8 weeks away from my wedding and upset that my arms are in a worse of condition with no offer to fix them just a partial refund for that area. If that's not bad the area is constantly now breaking out with marks on my skin due to ingrown hair and removing the hair often as I have no choice to remove it often due to the thick state its been left in. My doctor even prescribed me antibiotics to try and reduce the acne breakouts but its a short term fix to a long term solution. Not only will I have thick stubble hair on my upper arms but also acne marks so thank you for ruining my arms and skin and only offering a partial refund for leaving them in a worse state then they where to begin with. Complaints procedure is a joke,, never felt like I had been taken seriously by branch or reigonal manager. Do not know what to so going forward but they have taken away all my confidence at a time I need it most. So upset with the Wolverhampton clinic. Do not know why I should have to look into paying another company for additional treatment to fix their mess, when consultants at other companies have said it can be treated with a higher energy level.

I am in my early 20s so I felt I was too young to be going through this.  The ingrown hairs were really dark so there was no hiding. Skn clinic has changed my life, I wish I could post before and after pics. If you see what my face looks like now you scream. I saw results in a month and I have done 10 sessions so far. My face is bump less and the dark scars are lightening. As for the hair, I went from shaving twice a day to twice a month. By the way I am dark skinned girl, full of melanin. I highly recommend Roma from the Shepherd?��s Bush Clinic she is the best out of all them, she attacks the hair like a ninja, she?��s not scared of the machine and she really gets into those hairs. The day she was not available to do my treatment I cried because I know the results won?��t be as good and it was true. I have never used anyone but Roma since I joined the clinic.

I spoke to a lady on the phone who said I could not change my appointment (even though my voice was so croaky etc) so I asked to speak to the manager who shouted at me on the phone and said that she will not say anything different than her colleague and that I was clearly not going to go to the consultation and just wanted my money back. I was so ill that I just cried and couldn't believe what had happened even though I had used them before for 16 sessions. I was treated as if I was a trouble maker. My husband called on the day of my appointment to make a complaint but he spoke to someone else and managed to change my appointment. I went to the appointment just to get my money back as I could never spend money with a company like that again after my treatment on the phone. I will never use them again after that bad experience as it really knocked my confidence and I felt I was put down whilst I was feeling vulnerable.

I have purposely waited to do my review after my 6 sessions and some time to figure out if it actually worked. The first 3 sessions I had just did not work I was shaving as that?��s what I had to do rather than waxing and it seemed there was more hair than ever ! I had different ladies each time who seemed to do it differently some didn?��t go low enough round my lip with the laser. On my forth visit I had a lady who I?��d never had before. I told her I wasn?��t happy with the results and she recommended I up the laser and use a different one. They?��d always be conscious of doing this before because my skin tone is slightly tan. So when I got onto the new laser the laser burnt it felt so hot and I could smell burning , when I looked in the mirror after my upper lip was BRIGHT red,more red than its ever been, I ran to my car and drive home I put all my after Care treatments on it. The next day I woke up with lumps on my upper lip it was awful and so so so embarrassing! I called the clinic and sent them an image they said it was heat lumps. It took a week and a half to go. I think the staff were good but some weren?��t as experienced as others and it really shown throughout my sessions. They were all lovely and I can?��t complain to much about the service. My main complaint is that the laser didn?��t work so well until they changed me to the higher one , at this point I only had 2 sessions left on the other laser which started to make a difference. Basically if they started this higher laser sooner I would have had better results. I know it?��s not guaranteed to give you compete hair loss but I know after the higher laser I seen more hair loss. The hair now grows fine and not as often which is good but I think I needed a few more sessions on the higher laser. I would still recommend skin clinic Manchester but I would advice you find a good laser therapist and stick with the same one as much as you can. Overall I?��m okay with my results but I could have been happier if they upped the laser sooner. I think I could do with a few more sessions on the higher laser but I don?��t really want to waste anymore money if I?��m stuck with a therapist who isn?��t experienced, I also don?��t want to spend more money as it already cost me over �300 !",Positive,0.9721,0,0,Hair Loss,0,0,Laser Hair Removal,0,0,0,0,0,cost,time,staff,0,0,0,happy,results

However the train I was waiting for was cancelled but it was announced another would be arriving within 15mins time. I rang skin customer service to explain due to this I may be a few minutes late and was told by the person who took my call they would  contact the clinic to inform them. A few moments later it was announced that the train due to arrive would now be arriving within 30mins. I therefore contacted skin again to inform them I would now not b able to attend the appointment as this would put me way over my appointment time. The advisor who I believed to be called Nicola said she would see if there was a later appointment however after checking informed me there wasn't any but she could book me in for sat. I explained I couldn't confirm it until I had checked my diary to which she replied well you need to re book or you will occur a cancellation fee. I explained I would be making another appointment once I had arrived home. Nicola became some what abrupt and said well we have a policy and if you don't make a booking you will be charged so I'll book you in for sat. I again explained I couldn't confirm I could attend this until checking my diary which I would be able to do once I had arrived home in 10mins time. Nicola continued to insist I make an appointment there or then or occur a cancellation fee. By this time I had lost my patience with Nicola and told her to go ahead and do wat she had to do but if I couldn't attend the sat appointment I would have to rearrange it to which she replied you will be Charged if you do that. I then told Nicola I would not be attending any appointment she made for me that I was unable to do so and I would not be paying any cancellation fee! Nicola then told me she would allow me up until 11am that day to re book or used her favourite threat of occurring a cancellation fee! I arrived home ten minutes later re booked with another advisor with no issues. I have now been using skin for 7yrs and will have to do so for the rest of my life due to the condition I have. I have never once cancelled an appointment or been late. The girls that work in bold St clinic are all wonderful and very professional,which is more than I can say for Nicola. While I appreciate you have a cancellation policy I don't think I was unreasonable asking to be able to arrive home to check my diary rather than committing to an appointment I could not attend, and  I certainly did not take kindly to basically being threatened with a charge over and over again!

I went and the consultant there then advised I need to be referred to a doctor in the London Harley Street branch for which another �25 booking fee was then collected and I was told that the total �50 spent would be deducted from my consultation fee of �100. This was false as I paid an additional �100 after my consultation at Harley Street to which I was later told I was mosadvised and there is a surcharge on price when seeing one of the ?��specialist doctors?�� at London Harley Street. The doctor Brazzini finished her which assessment of me and simply explained what I should do but with no written follow up. The prescription given to me which I took to my chemist was not legible due to the handwriting of the doctor. I spent 2 weeks chasing Sk:n for a typed prescription with the instructions for application so I could go back to my chemist to get the medication. The prescription did not even detail the size / volume of the medicine that the chemist should provide to me so my chemist and myself just assumed the size that will be sufficient for 3 months treatment. It was only until I found the doctors personal assistant?��s email by googling her did I get a response (the PA is great and replied within hours of receiving the email).

During the months of my treatment so far I have had to use the call centre around 6-8 times, either in response to messages from SKN because they wanted to cancel/rearrange appointments, or because I needed to change one. Every contact with the call centre has been on a scale of disappointing to frustrating to, frankly, near-traumatic. They have failed to send messages through to the clinic, sent inaccurate messages, been very rude and even hung up on me. Today was the worst (rude, obstructive and hung up) so I called them back and asked to speak with a manager to make a complaint. I got the stock 'no managers are available' response which the agent would/could not deviate from.  I asked for a copy of the phone conversation (which they say are recorded) and was told that my request would be sent to a manager who would decide whether I could have a copy.  I asked for a manager to call me back and was told that the agent would request that but the manager would decide whether to call me or not.  I was calling to change an appointment in 48 hours (they charge if less than 24 hours notice is given) so I asked for a message to be sent to my clinic to call me back today.  So far I have not received a call.  So I am about to drive from my village into the city to speak to the clinic staff directly.  That is the only way I can be sure of avoiding being charged for a failed appointment.

My skin had never been as bad as it got. When trying to treat such a small area it spread across my face resulting in more acne appearing, in places I never got it. My acne appeared a lot worse from the products so had to stop. After stopping, my skin calmed down a week later and have been refunded for the products and two remaining peels but I feel I should be refunded for the three peels (including the one I had) because it wouldn't have worked anyway without the full course so I don't think it's fair keeping one peel payment.

When I eventually did get the appointment at Sunday 2nd July at 1.20  I attended at the correct time having received texts and phone calls to ensure that I did.   when I arrived I was told take a seat and wait to be called for my appointment at 1.20.      I soon realised that there were several other patients that had been waiting for up to an hour to be seen.    What would you have done if I had attended my appointment one hour late?    I do not live nearby to the clinic and had to travel to get there.      Once some of the patents walked out because of the wait and asked for their deposit to be repaid I realised that other patents were before me and it was going to take over an hour before I would be seen.  I had not been alerted to the delay when I booked in and waited over 15 minutes when I realised that I would have to ask the staff whether I would also have a long wait.    I was told that I would.    I had my husband waiting for me in the car so I could not agree to the unacceptable delay.    No explanation of the day was given.   There does not seem to be sufficient qualified staff to deal with the workload although the clinic are advertising special offers.     it felt like there were patients packed in for the money only and no client care.,Negative,-0.7942,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,special offer,time,staff,0,0,0,0,0

It was complete shambles and a big disappointment. After the second course, one of their therapist Sara who is probably the best one there told me I was put on the olive skin setting although I am quite fair. She mentioned I probably need a different setting as it would be unlikely to remove finer hairs. She however did not patch test me and when I attended the 3rd treatment I had a different therapist who refused to use a higher energy as I was not patch tested. When I voiced my concerns she reassured me if I did not get a good result she will give me a further treatment for free. At my fourth treatment I discovered I was still on the same setting the olive skin one but a higher energy level. No surprise I did not get a good result and was still shaving once a week. My fifth course was done with Sara who was fantastic and I had a brilliant result, only shaved once between treatments. I asked to have my subsequent appointment with Sara. However when I turned up for my appointment Sara changed shifts and none informed me from Skin Victoria. When I tired to reschedule with her she was booked for several days and the manager refused to do anything about it despite the fact that my laser hair removal only takes 10-15 minutes as I was only treating the upper lip area. I had to complain to skin customer service and the manager phoned me an hour later to offer me an appointment with Sara the next day. When I attended my last treatment with Sara, the manager was present when I was booking my additional free session and she refused to give me the session they promised to compensate for the fact that they treated my on the lower energy setting on the third occasion due to failing to patch test me.

However, upon inquiry on those clinics I always ended up finding out they only do IPL which obviously not going to work for me. Just this Monday, I googled any clinics nearby offering the 'real' laser treatment and came across sk:n... I immediately booked a consultation and went to their clinic the following day due to their 40% discount promo. Upon knowing that the clinic is located in James Cook Hospital, I then realized this clinic can be trusted 100%. Everything was explained to me very well in my consultation day. After my patch test has been done, I immediately said 'yes' for the entire 8 course treatment as ive already seen a difference on the tested area.  Since I am in my transitioning phase (male to female), I would definitely go back to skin not just to complete my current 8-session treatment but to get another course for the rest of my body parts.

I was briefly talked through several treatment options but felt a bit confused and overwhelmed by the choice. I would have preferred having paid to be given their expert opinion on what would have best suited my skin type. I was also recommended Skin's own brand glycolic facewash cleanser. After using this for 2 weeks my skin had a really bad break out (I've never suffered from acne before) and on calling the clinic I was advised that my skin was purging and to continue with the product. After a further weeks use my skin had never looked worse and left me with unsightly red marks so I quickly switched back to my dermalogica special cleansing gel (lifesaver!). My skin has since began to clear but it has left behind a lot of hyperpigmentation. Products can react differently on all skin types, but in hindsight I wish I'd researched more into glycolic acid as I have since found gentler treatments that don't cause the diverse side effects especially when my skin was clear to start with, I don't believe such a harsh product should have been recommended for my sensitive skin when there are alternatives with less risk.

Sk:n,wider industry competitor,Nicole,2017-05-06T13:22:34Z,1  stars,"Do not trust these clinics!!!!!!!!! unprofessional, incompetent and unreliable. ""Number 1 Skin Clinic"" is the biggest lie ever.","I am so disappointed with the professionalism of these clinics in particular the Fulham Broadway clinic I would NOT recommend it even to my worst enemy and I will not be having my treatment done here. I paid �100 for a consultation with a very unprofessional doctor who reassured me about nothing and basically acted like he didn't give a s*hit and would rather be sat on his sofa at home. They are way more expensive than they are worth I wouldn't even expect this from the NHS. This clinic claims to be ""number one"" but I'n not really sure who awarded them this title because it couldn't be less true I'd actually rather be treated by the National healthcare. I booked to have my treatment done after my consultation, and then I was called a day before by the clinic only to be told it had to be postponed because of a 'broken machine', the treatment was rescheduled to two weeks later and then AGAIN a day before I received a phone call telling me my appointment had to be cancelled because the 'machine was still broken'......they couldn't even tell me when I'd be able to have my treatment done because they were unsure of when this 'machine' would be fixed. Unacceptable. Over my dead body would I now put my skin in their hands. I would encourage anyone to go elsewhere for any kind of procedure as matters of your skin etc are much too important to be put into the hands of incompetent people and an unprofessional business. I read plenty of bad reviews about this clinic but still went forward with booking consultations and appointments to have a birthmark removed from my lip, something that has caused me problems for many years, but I tried to hope for the best and thought 'everywhere has some bad reviews' but seriously. This place is BAD!!!!! I did not feel reassured about anything or comfortable in fact I'm glad this happened because I cant imagine how competent they would be in solving my problem. I have been so anxious about this procedure, just wanting to have it over with and every time it gets cancelled last minute, what sort of joke is this? If I am paying for a service I expect to be able to at least choose the date? I don't know where they get off charging so much for such s*hitty service. You can't even call the individual clinics directly!!!!! You have to go through 'head office' who seem just as incompetent as the rest.",Negative,-0.9904,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,expensive,time,professional,0,0,0,glad,0

Booking appointments has proved difficult, I was informed that I would receive a call back within the next week or so after my second treatment to book the next one however 6 weeks later I still hadn't received a phone call, after finally managing to get hold of the clinic I was informed that they were fully booked for the next few weeks. A week after my next appointment was due I spoke to the call centre and cancelled, they were unable to get through to the clinic themselves but assured me they would send an email confirming to the clinic the cancellation. However on the afternoon of the appointment I received a phone call to say that I had an appointment scheduled for 1pm. They had clearly not bothered to check their emails! I am extremely disappointed with the organisation level of this clinic, lack of information and communication.

But I was recommended dermaquest dermaclear and a course of peels. This caused a big blemish breakout which did not improve after 6 weeks of treatment. I went back to my oxy10 (benzoyl peroxide) and acne completely under control again within a week or 2. I did ask repeatedly if they had anything else to offer but only a deeper peel which I chose against. To be honest I thought they might have offered a consultation with the dermatologist perhaps but I guess there are limited options for acne treatment. This has reaffirmed how great Oxy10 is! At this clinic they were very negative about it: why?? It really works for me. There is a great moisturiser mixed in with the BP which combats the drying. The BP kills acne bacteria. Only downside: it bleaches your sheets! I now wash it off before bedtime and use Tea tree oil at night. Due to some stupid EU law, Oxy10 is unavailable in the UK so you have to order it from Malaysia via eBay. To be fair I will still occasionally use dermaquest :  it is good for closing pores on my nose for some reason.

After each treatment I expressed my concern but was told I should see improvements after my course had ended. I did not see any improvement what so ever infact it had caused my skin to become worse. My skin was very inflamed and sore. Because of this I logged a complaint on the 28/09/16 and I am yet to hear back from the clinic to refund me my money. I am a reasonable person and I understand everybody's skin is different so results may vary however it is completely unacceptable to make my skin worse. I followed the nurses instructions regarding after care and use of their products religiously. I would have expected my skin to remain the same or improve - not worsen. I trusted the nurses at this clinic which was a very bad idea. Skin caused my confidence to plummet even more than when I first went into the clinic!! Lastly the whole complaints process has been awful. I feel like I have been passed to pillar to post and every time I'm told I will get a response I am thobbed off with another excuse.

He was very careful in making sure that they were even and looked as natural as possible. When I was in the clinic I was happy with the result. However since the swelling has gone down I can't tell any difference, not even my boyfriend noticed that I've had them done. I had to pay for a full syringe which is �285 and I am disappointed that for that amount of money there's no difference. I wish I had insisted that the full syringe (which I paid for) was used as that hopefully would have given a difference that is noticeable to me. I was also surprised that there wasn't any follow up appointment and when I asked about aftercare the doctor had to ring the receptionist because he didn't know the answer. He was a lovely person however didn't seem 100% on the process which could be why no difference has really been made.",Positive,0.9652,0,0,0,0,Lip Fillers,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,person,0,0,0,helpful,natural

After 4 effective treatments with minor discomfort and hardly any redness after the procedures, on this occasion, the staff member (Kirsty, I think) increased the strength of the laser without informing me. The first 5 laser zaps (as I call them), was on the right-hand-side of my upper lip and was extremely painful. The staff member stopped the machine of her own accord to readjust it for a few seconds. Again, I was not informed of what was happening. The rest of the procedure, although painful and brought tears, was bearable. My upper lip area was very red and was painful which did not happen in the previous sessions. The right hand side was especially red, painful, hard and swollen. Aloe Vera gel was applied twice. I mentioned the pain and found the staff quite dismissive, stating that it was more effective on a stronger setting and that redness was normal (not normal for me on previous sessions). I rushed home and sprayed with Avene thermal spray and applied cold water compresses on the lip area and more Sk:n  aloe vera gel. 5+hours later, I'm having difficulty sleeping, the right side is still sore, the redness has gone down but is discoloured compared to the rest of the lip, it is still hard and swollen. I am worried about long term damage and scared of returning for session 6.

There was no upselling of treatments or products which was one thing I was worried about as it would have made me question their ethics. Instead the plastic surgeon really seemed to care about his patients, he made absolute sure it was something I definitely wanted to go ahead with before proceeded. The mole excision took about 20 minutes in total, I felt no pain whatsoever, it's a weird sensation when they're sewing the stitches but like I said no pain whatsover. My mole was about 3mm in width and was just to the right of my cleavage. It wasn't particularly repulsive I had just never liked it and knew I'd be happier without it. I can happily say I stand by that now 2 weeks after the removal. My scar is healing very nicely and will just be a thin white line once fully healed, I'd imagine with a touch of concealer it would be completely invisible. I didn't follow the exact instructions of the doctor when it came to aftercare. I was advised to leave it dry and covered for 2 days but I took the dressing off after two days and popped a  waterproof plaster over it for a further 5 days, just to be cautious. I wiped it with warm water and salt after around 3 days and patted dry I continued to do this every couple of days.

I appeared to have more wrinkles under my eyes and down the side of my face and a deep dent in my cheek had appeared. It looked like displaced wrinkles. I went back for advice and he was very defensive and about my unhappiness and advised that the under eye wrinkles appearing could not be resolved. He told me it would wear off after a few months. He offered a top up treatment which he administered and applied a lot more injections with greater force than the first time which were extremely sore with more blood evident  - he also injected lower down the side of my face this time.

So today I phoned up for my next top up session only to find I am through to the central skin customer services department, and when trying to book I was told I would have to have another consultation before treatment as I haven't been treated for just over 12 months. This is contrary to the management of my treatment in the past. The man I spoke to on the phone was next to useless during my call. The main reason I continued to visit Mapperley Park was that I had already had my consultation, so if I need another consultation before continuing my treatment I will look elsewhere closer to home. Overall I would say that skin is an awful thing to happen to Mapperley Park Clinic and a company I will avoid in the future.",Negative,-0.4588,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,person,0,0,0,0,0

When the product arrived it was the wrong product. I did call them on the number that they provided and I explained the problem. The lady that I was speaking to told me that the correct product will be delivered to me by the time that I came back from holiday. I subsequently ran out of this product whilst on holiday and as it is the only product that I can use, without it causing a breakout, I was very disappointed with Skin. Despite this I was hopeful that my skin would return back to normal because the lady had promised that the product would be delivered for when I was back from holiday. This however was not the case. I called up again and the lady told me that I should receive the product in the next few days (again this was a further delay). I told the lady that this delivery experience had not been great. The lady did not apologise at all; she simply said that the product was out for delivery now. She also told me that they had to arrange a collection for the wrong product and that I had to stay in until 6pm for the collection to happen. As I lead a very busy lifestyle this is of great inconvenience to me. The very fact that I have not been given an apology or a discount for a months delay is TERRIBLE customer service. I have spent thousands on buying treatments and products from this company for years, and the fact that this has happened is incredibly disappointing. They clearly don't care about their customers, which is evident from the fact that they do not have a clear complaints procedure.",Negative,-0.9447,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,time,service,0,0,0,0,0

(I thought I was paying for a chunk of time for laser on SK blemishes, not per SK) I don't remember being given this on paper - but again I didn't ask. Finally, when I indicated an additional SK for treatment which was on my collar bone, I didn't check or ask to check that we understood the one I wanted rid of so I paid an extra chunk of money to have removed an SK I wasn't bothered about, and the one visible above many necklines is still there.

I never felt taken advantage of or like I was just another ""routine"" payday to him.  The hours of operation are a huge bonus as they are open 7 days a week. The entire staff was accommodating and the service superior. Special shout out to Jax at the reception desk, she truly went above and beyond and she is absolutely hilarious! She made an awkward situation completely comfortable, I felt right at home. When choosing a doctor,  I believe your first experience with the staff makes all the difference, no matter how great the physician is, if the customer service is lacking, most people will take their business and money and spend it elsewhere.

They suggested 6 weeks of treatment, including Isolaz treatment as well salicylic 20% peel while using Skinceuticals .3% retinol in between treatments, I am also on antibiotics (Lymecycline) . When the treatments finished my sk:n did look a bit better, I went away quite positive however 2 weeks later after using the retinol every night and the moisturisers they suggested in the morning, I had quite a severe outbreak (worse than prior to my visit). I went back to sk:n to ask what the hell was going on, they arranged an appointment with doctor. I then stopped using the retinol because I felt this was the problem and yes it stopped my outbreak. Today I went to the doctor where he prescribed me Isotrex, something my GP prescribed me for my first outbreak 3 years ago. I'm unhappy with the treatments as I feel they did ABSOLUTELY nothing to control my acne just give me temporary results.My experience was a huge waste of money and a huge waste of time.

The treatment process HURTS in some places, but since having my first treatment the speed at which my hair grows has reduced dramatically- I can actually go all weekend without shaving my legs and not feel stubbly. I'm not saying it will work that way for everyone- my black dots are still there but I assume they will go away as I continue with the course.

I decided to pay a visit to Skin in Guildford. The staff were friendly and approachable. I met with a Skin consultant and explained my problem, she said laser treatment would take them off at the cost of �300.00. I decided to take the plunge and after the consent forms couldn't be found i was told we could sort the consent form after the procedure. The laser was set to 10mm which seemed pretty big at the time, I wasn't told what would happen after the procedure. The treatment was carried out and some antiseptic gel rubbed on my hand. I was given a form after the procedure to sign, as no consent form for ""laser wart removal"" could be found I was made to sign a ""laser vein removal"" form then sent on my way without any other advice. The past 5 weeks have been a nightmare. Being a plumbing and heating engineer I need my hand for work, my job description was listed on my personal details when I arrived. Day two of the procedure I had to go to the doctors as the burns looked serious, they described the wounds as ""serious"", I was bandaged up and sent away, I spent a week off work as I couldn't use my hand, one of the warts was on my knuckle so the burn means I can't move that finger. A week later the wounds seemed to get worse, I walked into a pharmacy to have them take another look, they looked shocked and advised me to go to hospital, after a hospital visit I was bandaged up again. I'm going to left with pretty bad scars and still have a bandage on the deep wound apparent on my knuckle. I would say whoever did my procedure didn't really know what they were doing and I'm pretty sure I'm scared for life, if you read this review I'll be more than happy to send you the photos of my hand after the procedure leading up to now 5 weeks on, you will be shocked.",Positive,0.9627,0,0,0,0,0,0,Wart,0,0,0,0,cost,time,staff,0,0,0,happy,0

What I didn't know at the time is that it's far from honest as anybody having problems after surgery, or ending up with horrendous results are gagged, ignored and simply cannot post about their experience. Aftercare is non existent when it is really needed as is the companys complaints procedure. That's when the hell really begins and unfortunately I am not the only case.

I had a few issues with mental health and they talked me through my options and helped every step of the way. My Patient Coordinator Natalie answered all my questions promptly and I emailed her quite a lot haha! She was amazing. On the day of surgery I went to Preston First Trust and wow!!! What amazing staff they have there I had such a wonderful experience. My recovery has been great although I underestimated how hard it would be with a baby.

MYA Cosmetic Surgery,direct,S Oliver,2019-02-02T07:16:03Z,1  stars,Badly let down by Mya.,"My experience with Mya was upsetting and stressful. After 6 months of planning, consultations, pre op appointments, travelling to and from the clinic and arranging mine and my partners work and other commitments around my planned surgery and appointments.. it was cancelled 1 week before I was supposed to under go the procedure. I was extremely upset and the options offered to me were to have a full refund or start the whole process again with another surgeon. The whole process meaning all my pre op appointments that had taken me months to under go, and to start the process again in 6 weeks time. I was never really offered an explanation as to why my surgery was cancelled at such short notice and asked for a manager to contact me as I felt I had wasted a lot of time and felt that the options I had been given were not particularly adequate. When I finally got hold of a manager, I found them particularly rude and whilst I was trying to explain the situation was basically told it wasn?��t Mya?��s fault. The manager also kept trying to pin the blame on my Patient Co-ordinator, who i actually felt was not to blame in any way, but she had just been in the unfortunate position of having to tell me that my surgery had been cancelled at short notice. When I tried to explain this to the practice manager, as I felt she was putting words in my mouth, she asked me if I was actually going to let her talk? I was disgusted! I had contacted her to make sure this experience didn?��t happen to anyone else and to explain that I felt it could have been handled better. I felt it was inappropriate to speak to me like that, and after all, I was blameless in this situation. I had wasted a lot of time, money and planning to ensure my surgery could go ahead. Even after all of this, is took almost a month to get my refund. This made it difficult for me as was then in a position where I had to start the whole process again with another company, and Mya had my money! I felt badly let down by Mya. I would never recommend them, and am disgusted with the way I was spoken to by a Practice Manager.

Mya said they just needed a signed form saying that states I am medically fit. But as I am chasing this back and forth it turned out there was another form that Mya had sent. Eventually I got a letter from my doctor stating that mine is a habit not a medical problem. But now Mya did not care to see it after me paying for that letter. Mya keep saying I had therapy when I didn't I did a questionnaire! The head nurse never met me she just pulled out of thin air that I may pull my stitches out. Shows lack of knowledge on trich.

This doctor told me what he could do for me and I felt confident that he knew what he was talking about and the procedure would go well. I was happy for around 3 days after seeing my results, however things changed drastically over the course of a year. It was as if my old nose ?��grew back?��. My nose was left deviated, wide and completely unsymmetrical, one nostril blocked and totally bulbous. It took 6 months for MYA to arrange for me to see my surgeon who told me to come back at 1 year and arranging the second appointment was just as much of a battle. I told my surgeon my concerns and he made me feel terrible telling me I had unrealistic expectations and admitting no fault, but also agreeing to a revision. However having researched him more I am totally unconfident in his ability to revise my nose and will have to pay to go elsewhere. If I had been allowed the time to think about the procedure and research more I would have found the countless other patients he has botched and chosen to go to someone more capable. But I was offered lucrative discounts (�500 off) and last minute cancellation dates to cut the wait time signficantly as long as I put the full amount down within a week.

Being 29 years old with 2 children and no desire to have anymore I looked at myself in the mirror with a chest that I felt appeared like that of a very old lady. Through breastfeeding and weight gain and drastic weight loss I was left with very little breast tissue and what were empty pockets of skin. I really didnt expect much hope jn terms of improvement. My coordinator was supportive and an attentive listener (Nicky@Rodney street Liverpool) and she advised me to speak with Dr Mahdi. She told me all about him and how she felt he was the perfect choice for me through her experiences with his work. He completely was. He was honest, thorough, realistic, passionate, informative and importantly very precise. The surgery went extremely well with all involved at the hospital being exceptionally nice and the after care with my nurse Jeanette at Rodney street Liverpool has been great! She has listened, advised, supported and gone above and beyond for my care.

I went to London to see the surgeon though and I waited for 2 hours to be seen with no acknowledgement or apology. Absolute rubbish considering they charged �7800 for rhino! The surgeon clearly knew his stuff and I'm sure he would of done a great job but he rushed me through the consultation as it was near the end of the day and I felt for almost 8000 I wanted a perfect experience. He cancelled the poor guy waiting to see him after me too. The first consultation is also a waste of time as it's with the patient coordinator who simply tells you the price which could be done on the phone.

To the most amazing team at First trust such incredible nurses who made me feel right at ease continually made me laugh making everything a lot easier to the MOST AMAZING surgeon Dr Traynor such a fabulous talented surgeon he's very straight to the point but also very easy to talk to and super funny! When I had my first consultation with him at MYA I knew I made the right decision! MYA nurses with the aftercare are fabulous can't fault them either always giving 100% no matter what! so thank you to the Manchester MYA team and first trust hospital for the most amazing experience and giving the best customer care possible always going above and beyond.,Positive,0.999,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,easy,chat,0,0,0,thank you,0

The only negative I have to say are the reception staff are not very friendly and don't make You feel that welcome and also on the day of my operation everyone was so great and really put me at ease, but at the end of the day I was waiting for my family to come and pick me up and it took a bit longer than Expected and I felt one of the older nurses was a bit impatient and trying to get me out quickly.

MYA Cosmetic Surgery,direct,lauren,2017-04-25T23:29:10Z,3  stars,Poor after care,"I had rhinoplasty with dr giannitrapani at Fitzroy. My first consultation with my PC went well so I booked a surgeon consultation for the following month. All of a sudden my PC disappeared off the face of the earth, maybe advice to MYA would be to not have new customers be PC'd by employees who are just about to take their annual leave and travel the world for 18 months which was mentioned in the email I received after plenty of ignored emails before my visit. I met with Dr G and he definitely knows what he's talking about and he was very honest, so was happy to have him for surgery and paid my �500 deposit to book the date which would've been 6 months later. After this I met with my new PC who seemed friendly, however a month or so later I received an email from someone with a different name. To this day I couldn't tell you who my actual PC was. A month before surgery I paid the extortionate amount �6250 making the surgery a total of �6750 (bare in mind my nose only had a very small bump I found this a huge amount of money but thought you get what you pay for so went ahead.) and the call started rolling where I met up with nurses etc who I cannot fault they were lovely. However I do remember having to chase up an appointment for my pre surgery about medical information a week before surgery which isn't very organised. Moved on to surgery date, everything was organised and went well. I did not appreciate the way I was treated by a certain nurse who didn't speak to me kindly once I woke up, and the fact they offered me a menu to choose from yet I never actually got asked what I wanted?? Just a small thing lol. I waited for 4 hours to be discharged due to him being busy which isn't good when you're forgotten about and just left alone in a room on an uncomfortable bed. I left eventually and next day had my splints out and a week later had my cask taken off to finally reveal my nose which I was happy with. 3 months later dr g took a look when it was still completely swollen and instantly discharged me even tho I said about how my breathing was the same. But god forbid if anything was wrong with it! 6 months post op I started getting anxious about bumps appearing on my nose that made it look bent, so I have emailed 4 times and made 2 calls, within the calls where I requested to speak to someone for advice I was put on hold for so long it eventually hung up on their behalf which I feel was their plan all along if it happened two times. Funny how it all gets complicated now yet when I called to make a payment I had the quickest customer service you could imagine. Overall, I wouldn't use MYA again simply because I wouldn't trust the after care.

Two days after that conversation/consultation i had a phonecall asking why I hadn't booked my date yet & I explained that I needed the extra �500 before I could do so. The lady told me that I could definitely book with �500 so within two days the rules has somehow changed? God damn awful to allow me to leave upset yet I could have booked all along.

MYA Cosmetic Surgery,direct,Samantha Dyson,2017-03-27T15:40:28Z,1  stars,The worst most degrading experience of,"I arrived at MYA Manchester ready for my Vaser lipo at 12pm stated, after an hour and 20 minutes wait I finally get took for what I thought was for my procedure, I was wrong the man who took me into a consultation room repeatedly told me ' I don't work for MYA I'm just here today' so this made me feel very uncomfortable. After the paperwork had been signed and he had gave me my power gown etc he then said the anaesthetist would be in shortly. I waited 1hour 45 minutes before he arrived I was sat on a plastic chair in a freezing cold room. Not once did anyone come in to see how I was. This was unacceptable and not what I was expecting especially after paying over 6000 pound. He then asked me to change into my gown I did ask could I wait as the room was so unbelievably cold he said the surgeon will be in strait after, so I did as he had asked, I then waited another 35 minutes before the surgeon had arrived he drew up the areas and then said we had to wait for the theatre to become available that was around another 30 minutes. The scrub nurses then came to collect me they asked if I had emptied my bladder I didn't because I didn't know I had to as I had no communication with anyone. I was then asked to use the public toilet which may I add any member of the public visiting MYA  and MYA staff are able to use. I was extreme uncomfortable as the gown was paper thin and was visibly see through! I felt embarrassed and degraded. I quickly ran back into the room where the lady asked if I was pregnant, I stated I wasn't and she took my word for it! NO PREGNANCY TEST was taken even though I got told beforehand that that was the procedure they did. I remember waking up after surgery begging for a blanket and I repeatedly was told you would get one in recovery! I was put in my garment and pushed to the recovery room which again was a consultation room but with this time a padded chair. I asked where my partner was I was told' oh I don't know do you want me to ring him and see' I was so upset and shocked I thought they would or rang when I had awoken from surgery to tell him everything went well but to my surprise they didn't! I received no after care advise no advise on how to stop the gallons of fluid leaking out of me or what to use to soak it up or at least try to. I finally was on my way home the time now was near to 7pm, I arrived home wet through I asked my partner to get my tablets from the bag which MYA provided me with to find loose tablets spread across the bottom of the bag!!! I have a small child she could of picked one up!!!!! I wouldn't ever go with MYA again  !!  DO YOUR RESEARCH! I will not let this go! I will take things further!

I have to say before going i was extremely nervous i had had very inconsistent patronising contact from customer care..i really think they need to retrain staff, it seems because its cosmetic that they think all customers are plastic bimbos. When parting with ALOT of money i dont expext to be called hun! Im a customer, a client i dont think in any other company where you were paying this much for a service you would  get talked to like a moran. I felt they were very insincere and uncaring of an emotion you might be feeling leading to surgery. They only kept upncontact until id transfer the money for operation. However saying all of this the surgeon and staff at hospital where amazing! I can not fault them. Dr marcellino came to see me when i arrived..seeing how nervous i was pushed my surgery forward so i was sitting around thinking. I was taken down to for the op by an African guy who kept me talking and made me feel calm then the anethitist came in and was so nice he gave me something to cam me down and next thing i knew i was coming around in recovery. They made sure i was warm and comfortable before taking me back to my room. I have read the staff where rude but mine where all lovley and caring. Nothing was too much. I was infact so greatful tonthem i made my husband get them chocolates. I know we pay for good care but the level of care and professionalism was to such a high standard. Also i adored the food! The beets and feta salad was amazing. Would go back to the same surgeon but not sure id go through mya again simply because i feel the contact was so poor before the op.

MYA Cosmetic Surgery,direct,Melissa Roberts,2017-01-29T12:44:04Z,1  stars,Botched with excuse after excuse,"Initially I was happy with the results as I had some swelling after a few weeks I noticed that some areas had been missed, and I was left with a large area of fat that was noticeable and had been missed. I went back to my surgeon and was told it was swelling and to come back after 6months, so I waited as requested and still noticed 2 Areas of noticeable fat still visible and could feel it had been missed. I went back again after 6months and was told I have to wait another 3 months for swelling to go down. This time I was told it was loose skin,  in the mean time I have had 10 courses of massages to make sure all fluid was being moved and also a pt to make sure I maintained my weight down. I said it was not all loose akin and you can feel the fat in the area. Again I was told it's swelling and to come back after its been a year. Unfortunately I have no confidence in what I'm being told,I wanted further work doing but feel my aftercare has been appalling and I have been treated like an idiot and that the fat I can see and feel is loose skin. The surgeon has not even said he would fix it which I was told when I sat with him of he had missed anything he would fix. So I have been fobbed off with am excuse everytime I have been to see him.

MYA Cosmetic Surgery,direct,Chloe Jennings,2017-01-24T14:03:06Z,4  stars,Great Company,My experience with Mya has been very good. All initial consultations were free which I thought was amazing considering some places will charge around �100 and you may not even use them! One small hiccup was my pre op appointment being cancelled just 15 minutes before my appointment! By this point I was already in London and around the corner which was rather annoying considering I live in Kent and couldnt see why they would not cancel a later appointment and give somebody else more notice than 15 minutes!  But other than this they have been fantastic and I am very grateful that they offer free aftercare as I was unfortunate enough to have a haematoma 6 weeks after my operation. I called the 24 hour emergency line and straight away they told me to come to the hospital with an over night bag and I was operated on first thing the next morning and had to spend an extra two nights in the hospital and it was all covered in the original cost.

MYA Cosmetic Surgery,direct,Olivia,2017-01-24T12:24:22Z,4  stars,Went with MYA as I wanted a specific surgeon,The beginning contact with MYA was fab they are very on the ball and have someone ring you as soon as you put interest in on the website etc. You are then assigned a girl who you chat to about the procedure and what you might want. they then suggest different surgeons who would be good for your case. You then book in to meet your surgeon for in my opinion a really quick consultation where you will talk through about positives/negatives and what they recommend. Then you have a cooling off period where I then booked in. I felt here my PC pushed me to make a payment 3 months in advance but because I had the money I paid. Once paid you dont here from your PC at all. I had to email her about my op time. Dr traynor was quick and ive probably met him about for around 20 minutes in total not including my operation. I chose him and wanted him because he has a good reputation and did a great job on my breasts so far. My nurses appointments have been really good and they have always been on time and on my 2 week one she booked me in for another appointment a week later just to check on something. I have one more appointment at 6 weeks then meet the surgeon again after 12 weeks. So far I have found it easy to rearrange appointments and the staff have all been lovely. The only thing I would suggest is perhaps the PC contacting you between paying and your operation just for a  call and having a receipt for payment because I wasnt sure they had taken the money and it is a lot of money.,Positive,0.9834,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,quick,staff,0,website,0,0,0

MYA Cosmetic Surgery,direct,MargoB,2017-01-18T09:46:08Z,1  stars,Nottingham office,My daughter recently had a very bad experience with MYA where in December after having a pre-surgery consultation with the consultant he cancelled the operation.  We had made a 2 hour journey to their facilities in Preston and was prepped ready for surgery.  The Nottingham office phoned and said not too worry about the money and I just needed to have another consultation before surgery.   The situation now is that they will not perform the operation and refusing to refund any monies. The excuse is that she is not suitable for surgery - they thought she was suitable for surgery when they booked her to have surgery and took �3000 off her.  The negotiations are continuing but I have little hope of reaching a satisfactory conclusion. I have seen a few posts like this and would like to hear from anyone else who has suffered a similar experience,Positive,0.8187,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Before I came to MYA i had a consultation with another company and it was a nightmare. I felt rushed and left feeling extremely stressed and they only wanted to give me 295cc aand to go infront of the muscle which is not what I wanted.  I then contacted MYA and when I had my first consultation with kimberly the PC in Nottingham and I knew I wanted to give MYA my money straight away.   I was put in touch with Dr mounir.... who btw is a boob God and deserves so much recognition! I re searched him loads and even came across his you tube channel of him performing ops. I really did my research and knew id be super happy with him and he also did my friends BA about a year ago. His consultation was amazing. He was so precise with his measurements and I felt so comfortable around him. He asked me what I wanted and listened to me. He gave me 430cc ultra high profile behinde the mmuscle... he could put big implants in me because I have 2 children so my skin on my boobs was stretchy anyway.  I never had any problems with my appointments and they made sure i had everything ready for my surgery... i was phoning them quite alot and aimee was lovely and was always happy to help me. I had my surgery at Preston first trust in Manchester and the staff were amazing. They went above and beyond to make me feel comfortable.  I felt rather I'll coming off the anesthetic and the pain killers didn't help... no exaggeration the nurses was in every 5-10minutes to check on me. I was one of the first in the hospital and one of the last out. They really do look after you. When having my 1 week and 6 week post op appointments my nurse is alice... she is lovely. After my op i was worried about a few things and she would answer straight away.. nothing is ever too much trouble for her. My scars are literally just tiny lines and so far I'm healing really well... I've had so many compliments and the confidence I have now is unreal. Alot of people who complain I fully beleive that either they havnt done their research propey on their procedure or didnt follow their aftercare properly, Because I followed everything to a T and touch wood I have had no problems at all. I have recommend MYA to a couple of friends and 1 of my friends is due to have her OP with dr mounir in a couple of months.

Once they had the scan they said I would need another procedure which I knew would happen but what I didn't know was they was about to charge me for the operation... disgusting! They give you a warranty for 10years for replacement of the implant but not once did they say at the first operation that you have to pay for surgery fees... what's the point in the warranty?? How else am I suppose to replace my implants??? Big con really to get more money from you!! I also wasn't very happy with my consultant he was rude and unfriendly, I asked for a different consultant but was told I couldn't have a new one. He had listened to what I wanted and after the procedure I expressed me opinions.

MYA Cosmetic Surgery,direct,Ellis Jones,2016-10-12T13:34:45Z,1  stars,"Surgeon was great, service was impersonal and rushed-Leeds","This review is for MYA Leeds...After a rushed consultation with the patient coordinator where she barely stopped for breath I met with my surgeon. I had multiple consultations with various companies and this was by far the worst, it was rushed, impersonal and I felt like one of hundreds of people who had sat there and listened to this forced speech. Multiple consultations had taught me that the most important thing was that you liked the surgeon and felt reassured by what he had to say. After much research I decided to go with Mr Muneer despite the poor service I had received prior to meeting him. He was great, and I am 100% happy with the results he has created. The aftercare at MYA however was horrendous. I was discharged with codeine and as a nurse myself I am fully aware that codeine is ineffective on a large number of people. My post-op pain was uncontrollable despite my best efforts. I was seen at the Leeds clinic 2 days post-op (which was terribly uncomfortable as I was at this stage struggling to get in and out of bed) after my partner had had to loose his temper with the nurse on the telephone to express how concerned he was about me as nobody really wanted to know. I left with the reassurance that their doctor on call would produce me a prescription for my partner to collect later. Which did not prevail. In a state of despair I got an emergency appointment at my GP after waiting around all day to collect the so called prescription that they had promised. I was prescribed tramadol and this saw me through the next few days of pain as things started to improve. The staff at the Leeds clinic were unhelpful and were reluctant to see me/give advice post op. I was given an emergency out of hours contact number too to use which was neither use nor ornament, it just made the battle to see someone when I was in utter desperation even harder. I would not recommend using MYA, it reminds me of a 'boob factory' with zero compassion or care in their nature. Mr Muneer was superb and if it wasn't for him I wouldn't have turned a blind eye to the poor initial consultation. 100% happy with my results, 100% unhappy with the service provided.",Negative,-0.9391,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,wait,staff,pain,research,0,helpful,results

I opted to visit the clinic in Manchester, as it was the one she'd visited, as well as my nearest. My consultation ran smoothly, with my patient co-ordinator being friendly and informative. I was impressed, and paid my deposit upfront, and the remaining cost a week or so afterwards. I did, however, find that once paid, my patient co-ordinator was extremely dismissive.  Upon my consultation, she informed me that she was having her implants replaced a week later, and this seemingly took priority over her patients, as I was never contacted again - not after my pre-op appointments, or post-op. When going through such a daunting process and with the amount paid out for procedures, I do feel that this is unacceptable.

I used the Fitzroy clinic, and I'm convinced half the reception/admin staff there were only there for the perks of the job. I met my PC Alice Potts, she's since left, and booked my surgeon consultation. When I returned a couple of weeks later to meet Mr Marcellino, my appointment was at 7.30. It was a Thursday night, I'd travelled two hours to be there, and I arrived to be told he was running late and it would be easier to re-schedule. (You could have called). I waited it out and was finally seen at 9.30pm. (He's lovely FYI, just use him through his own clinic). I went from the surgeon in with my PC and booked a date 15 days later (she wouldn't accept my query of late booking discount, so I wonder what counts as late), and I paid up. I returned for my pre-op 7 days before my surgery. All went ok. I arrived on surgery day at my allocated time of 7.30am, I was in theatre by 9am and back to my room by 11am. All the staff were perfect. However, they were short staffed. Another patient was having pain management difficulties so ALL staff were rallying around her. I was left for hours at a time, and eventually left at 7.45pm after a nurse promising me at 2pm I could go home in an hour. 7 days post op appointment I was surprised to find I needed a 14 day post op appointment as my stitches weren't dissolvable (my surgeon never uses dissolvable stitches) - it would have been nice to be pre-warned. 14 days post op, my stitches were removed. Six weeks post op. I got stuck on the M11 in traffic, I called and left a voicemail to say I'd be late. I arrived FIVE MINUTES LATE, to be told my nurse couldn't see me and she'd already gone and I should have called (I did). At this point in time I had a few difficulties with my incisions and insisted I needed to see someone. As I sat in the waiting room for about 20 minutes to see a nurse from the ward, my actual nurse scuttled past to leave!!! The ward nurse suggested I booked to see my surgeon regarding my incision. Two weeks later, I saw my surgeon. Fairly on time, he had nothing good to say about the receptionists either, he signed me off early ahead of my 12 week check up and removed my rogue stitch. I haven't been back to Mya since. The surgeon and ward staff were great, the rest of the staff need to take a reality check.",Positive,0.961,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,time,staff,pain,0,0,0,0

Rang a couple of days later and booked in and paid. 4 weeks later I was in London having it done! Arrived at the hospital at 7.30am and was out of surgery and back in my room by 11am. Had my own nurse who kept checking on me and making sure I was comfy and that the pain was bearable. I've just been for my 6 week check up today and my scars are fully healed, boobs have softened and dropped nicely. I had 300cc in my right and 325cc in my left.

MYA Cosmetic Surgery,direct,Chantelle S,2016-09-28T08:32:28Z,5  stars,"Trust worthy, safe, understanding, professional, extremely happy! A*****","I've had my breast enlargement with my MYA for 3years now, I am extremely happy with them, they look natural and I love them. Before I was a 34AA now I'm a 34DD. Before I found MYA I had a consultation with Harley medical, I found they were stuck up snobby and looked down on me made me and made me feel silly, they would only offer me a C cup which I didn't want if I was gonna go under the knife I thought I might aswel make it worth my while, I left there feeling upset and couldn't help thinking they didn't understand. I was online one night and discovered MYA. I had seen previously on a episode of Towie that Lauren pope had gone with them to have her implants replaced with them. I required a ring back with them and with in 30minutes or so I was talking to them and had booked my consultation, at this point I was full of excitement, the day arrived I got the train to London with my sister I turned up to a very clean building, and inside was very posh, I was welcomed by kind stunning ladies, my name was taken and I was told to sit in the waiting area, soon after I was called in by a lovely lady who asked me about what size and look I'd be going for, now unlike Harley medical I didn't hear them say ""cannot"" once, I know to a certain extent they can't always give you exactly what you want but it still felt like my decision and not them suggesting other ideas. she was very helpful and understood me, after chatting and explaining the procedure and that she asked a date and then it came down to the price, I was extremely shocked to how much it cost because that's one thing you never hear or you can't find it out straight away, it was costing �3950.00 which I thought was brilliant, I put a deposit down and walked out of that building so happy, I could not wait, a week later I had come back for my second consultation to meet my surgeon to  decide on size, he was lovely and understanding, in the end I went on the D-DD's round cups, and was having them put under the muscle to make them look more natural as I lacked breast tissue. It was the morning or surgery I got up nice and early and took a taxi down to London Highgate hospital, I turned up feeling welcomed and got my bags carried to my room, my room was big and had my own bathroom and tv, with in 20minutes or so the nurse came in to give me my gown and what I thought was a hat but in actual fact was knickers haha so when she came in finding me wearing them on my head I think she was quite surprised but it was funny, the sergeon came in and got his black marker out and drew where he needed too, then 15minutes later I was on my way down to theatre, at this point I was nervous and who wouldn't be if it was there first time going under the knife I didn't know what to expect, as I got there I did feel my heart beat faster but I was assured and was told to lay down on the bed where I had a lady and 2 others there checking me over, they explained what they were doing and within minutes I was asleep, and what to me felt like 5minutes was just over 40minites I woke up with a pair of breasts I was still half asleep at this point so wasn't to sure what was going on, I was wheeled back to my room in my bed, my friend did try to talk to me but i was still half asleep, I woke up not in much pain atall I was relieved it was done and couldn't wait  to look down to see, they were taped up but I could definitely see there was a pair of breasts, later on I was brought in dinner that I had previously chosen before I went into theatre, I ate it but couldn't keep it down but this is normal. I had two kind of jugs either side my bed joined to tubes going inside my breasts draining them it was quite weird but it was fine, the sergeon came in and told me everything was straightforward and was successful and there were no complications during surgery, after a few hours me and my friend chatting and looking at my new breasts the nurse came in to take the draining tubes out, it was a very weird sensation I have to say but I didn't hurt, it was time to go and I didn't stay in over night and my journey was only an hours length. But I was happy to leave and couldn't wait to get home and show my sister, you wouldn't have known id of been in and out the same day and walking around on the day of surgery. I signed some papers and they gave me a number incase of emergencies. I was given some antibiotics and pain killers which I collect from there little chemist at reception. I said my good byes and I was gone on my way. After the journey me and my friend went straight round hers and her mum was baffled and wondered how I was up and about , the first day was fine it was the second day I felt stiff and bruised but it was bearable I was still able to go shopping and buy some new clothes for my new shape. A week  went without any problems I went back to London for my check up and for my bandages to come off... It was exciting, the nurse took off the bandages and to me they looked quite weird because they hadn't settled and why would they of it had only been a week, but they were healing good. A month went by I kept them supported in a sports bra, after a while I noticed they started to become a part of me and looked like they had always been there like they were my own, 3years down the line, my confidence has grown and I love my breasts! If for some reason I ever had to have them replaced or I wanted them bigger I'd definitely without a doubt go back to MYA. Thankyou so much for changing my life!! I couldn't recommend you anymore!

The surgeon's and nurses are brilliant when you eventually get to see them, as every time I have been to MYA I have waited at least 30 minutes after my appointment time they are always running late. You can never get through to anyone on the phone as they never answer the phone. This was very worrying for me as I didn't find out if I was actually having surgery until 3days before my operation was due. MYA like to say how good they are but in actual fact they just want as much money as possible because once they have your money they don't need to keep you happy. I love my new assets and I'm very pleased with them although I'm not 100% happy as one boob falls to the outside when laid down and the insision is  wonky so you can see one scar even when I have a bra on. I'm told my breast will settle in time and it's nothing to worry about. So all in all they have done a good job on surgery but not good on customer service.

At this point I actually wasn't happy with the size I was given as I wanted to go bigger as mine were pretty much non existent but I wanted it done so bad I just went with it.. couple of weeks before my operation I had a call saying that i would have to swap surgeons so went back in to Mya to have a meeting with him (he was known as the big bob surgeon) after talking to the new surgeon I was over the moon I could actually have the size I wanted and was paying a lot of money for! Operation time everyone was beyond lovely,  made me feel so comfortable and in good hands! After operation again everyone so nice the 1st week after having the surgery was properly the worst week of my life couldn't sleep, uncomfortable bored with the lack of things I could do.

I hadn't planned on getting the surgery until next year but after seeing how good Dr Frati's work was I changed my mind just a few days after meeting with him- he knew exactly what I needed to get the perfect nose for my face. He was lovely when he saw me before my op and I'm due my post op check up with him next week in Manchester.

I was so excited, went for my first consultation in September 2014. Went to meet the surgeon and was told 550 cc but the girl who was looking after me said well if you decide bigger on the day - I'll order 550 and 600cc and you can decide. Went to London, paid for a hotel and all, had my last meal at 6:30 the night before the operation because they said not to eat past a certain time and I was due in at 10am. The next day I waited until 5:30pm (last on the list - they did 7 or 8 before me) so I hadn't eaten for hours and hours. The surgeon said no way could I have 600cc as his consultation we had decided on 550 - so I had been lied to. He said I could always have another consultation with him, cancel the op and go back but I had already spent too much on hotel and all and as I was already there...  All done and drains out at 8:30/9pm. No offer to stay in. Went back to hotel. Went to three month check up and also twice because stitches were leaking badly and got strapped up with an iodine bandage thing which did work tbh.  Didn't hear anything back - nothing about a 6 month check up, 12 month or any other check ups tbh. Was supposed to be offered to meet the surgeon again at the 12 month check up I think but he then didn't do Cardiff or even Bristol!!!!  Really let down. Boobs are not what I was looking for at all, they've dropped loads and to be honest yes they are better than what I had - but not �6000 better. Not impressed and would never recommend them!

I then wanted a date later on, but again was told I would have to pay extra because they would have to fly another surgeon out, although I was told they would work around me before any payment was made, I felt bullied in to making a quick decision by the advisor. The surgeon anaesthetist and the original nurse I had were absolutely lovely and made me feel at ease on the day. However after my surgery I had to wait a whole week to come back in for after care, when this is usually in the next day or two, after that I was not contacted again or checked up on for anything, I tried to voice concerns but again I was dismissed.

I was obviously very worried about this as the surgery could impact on my implant, leave a dent in my breast and leave a big scar. I thought it would be a good idea to speak to my MYA consultant before having any surgery done as he had recently conducted the breast re-augmentation. I was extremely disappointed by his response which was curt and not very helpful. It made me feel very upset and uncomfortable. I simply wanted to hear his advice and instead I felt like I was being a nuisance and taking up his time. I left feeling very worried and also felt that I was very much brushed to one side. He did not appear to have any concern for me at all. I did not pay for this appointment and I was left feeling that his attention was not focussed on what I was trying to ask him.

This has been ongoing on my boob for 1 year and a half and it's ruining my life. NHS won't touch it and I can't afford new implants only on a payment plan which I failed even though I've never missed a payment other credit.

I was dealt with very professionally through my consultations and on the day of my surgery i felt very nervous but was put at ease by the private hospital team straight away. The anaesthatist came to meet me before surgery and also my surgeon came to see me on the morning and put me at ease too. It was very fast on arriving that i was sent down to surgery so no waiting time hardly. In the anaesthetic room they were lovely and comforting i could trust them with my life i felt. Very professional. When i come round from surgery i was comforted and they made me laugh straight away in revovery. I was then wheeled to my provate room i was in before surgery and the nurse made sure i was ok and had everything i needed and relevent painkillers all the time. My surgeon came around to see me and made sure i was ok too. I had some tea while i was there and was later discharged that evening with all my aftercare and painkillers in hand. After 6 weeks tge surgeon called me back to check all was well with surgery and that i was happy.

On one occasion I rang to speak to my patient coordinator, then 10 minutes after I rang back another women answered and told me she wasn't in today when I literally spoke to her 10 minutes ago. I planned to have my operation on a certain day, it then got changed to a week after which was an inconvenience as I had a wedding and graduation soon approaching, however they assured me I would be recovered and well enough to attend. On the day of the operation I spent the whole day in a stuffy room, with no signal, the wifi wasn't working and one channel on the TV. I was in this room with no food and hardly any water from 8:00 till 5:00 only to be told the light in the theatre had broke. I thought this service for a private hospital was horrendous! Also no one knew what was going on so I was sat there guessing what was going on. They told me I was in the bad half of the hospital which explains the bad signal and wifi, well excuse me why am i paying for this service if that is the case. I paid for the wifi which didn't work and was unable to contact family to collect me from the hospital. This got delayed further to 15 days later. I was then told my addmission time was 11:00am by email and a MYA nurse, on the day of the operation the hospital staff was ringing me at 8:00am to see where I was because I was meant to be there. I had to rush to the hospital it was 45 minutes away and get checked in asap or I was going to miss my operation!!!

I would never recommend MYA to anyone. Complaint being ignored and patient satisfaction means nothing to them. I fought with them for 3 years to get to the point to do the revision session for me, it got cancelled on a day of surgery. I was told that they the Manager will get back to me to rearrange, which has never happened. Their delay in revision sessions caused me to miss the chance to complain about the surgeon who has done the surgery for me, and MYA seems to less bother about it. They got the money and they don?��t care anymore. DON?��T FALL IN TO THEIR TRAPS.

MYA Cosmetic Surgery,direct,Bethan Finch,2016-09-26T10:42:41Z,1  stars,The after care at Mya is shocking!!!! Do not book with them,"Ok my story is rather long, I went in for breast enlargement with mya on 2nd feb 2016 and everything was OK,  part from paying extra �500 for over night stay and not being fed? But apart from that everything was good, no pain. 2 weeks later I woke up in serious pain, one breast looked twice the size as the other. After sending pictures to mya hotline they advised me to travel back down to London ( nearly 3 hour drive) over the course of the next week I made 4 jounernys back to London to have my breast drained awake! (Very painful) this is called Seroma a build up of fluid around breast. on my 2nd visit that week Dr Frati asked me if I had changed dressing? I hadnt but The nurse had put me in wrong dressing so had to have it drained again as no pressure was on my breast therefore it filled back up again.. the following week my breast went rock solid so dr frati decided he was going to ""crack"" the scar tissue around the implant again another painful situation! Which still didn't solve my problem. Another week went past of me being off work unpaid even though I was advised 2 weeks would be plenty of time off work. By the 15th march 2016 I was back in London having my implant removed, washed and replaced back in my breast.. this time when I woke up I felt like I had been ran over by a bus! Was very painful.. after a long 6 weeks went by of still being off work healing my stitches were not healing... I had to head to Preston for more stitches. Now I'm left with one breast feeling very different to the other.. completely numb in my left breast... and a scar looking awful. I also have had a total of 14 weeks out of work, over �2000 extra cost in private prescriptions that could range from �20 to �150 over the course of 14 weeks, fuel costs from traveling back and forth to the hospital, congestion charge of �10 everytime we entered London, car parking of up to �100 some times depending on how long we would be in the hospital, over night hotel charges for my mum who stayed with me extra 2 nights in london (roughly �250 per night stay) to sum up this experience I would say completely awful. And fuel money traveling to Birmingham up to 3 times a week for dressing to be changed. Also the mental stress and upset this has caused me is unacceptable! Mya were very quick as a company to be ringing you getting you to book and pay but soon as they recieve your money they don't want to know. The clinic never answers the phone and the staff are very patronising towards you. The manager at the Birmingham clinic is so rude and no help what so ever her name is Amanda. You are made aware of problems happening but ""it's rare don't worry, sign here babe"" is the response I got! I think everyone considering surgery should be made more aware that there are a lot more problems happening that is made out. Now I think if it is so ""rare"" that a clinic manager should be aware of the problems people are experiencing. Also The waiting Time at the clinic is unbelievable, couple of times I've waited over 3 and a half hours at a time to see dr frati.. and this is a so called private clinic! I'm very disappointed the way I've been treated at mya, after care is totally shocking and I wouldn't recommend this company to anyone!",Negative,-0.9968,Breast Enlargement,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,charge,quick,staff,painful,0,washed,0,0

MYA Cosmetic Surgery,direct,kelly kenyon,2016-09-26T09:26:27Z,2  stars,Bad experience,At first I was happy with my results. They did my implants 4 months after I'd had my son. So as you can imagine I had some baby weight. My friends who have been to other surgeons have had to wait 9 months post baby to have there breast enlarged because of the weight issues amongst other things after having a baby. They where brilliant for the first 6 months but as I started to lose my baby weight the implants started to show. I have literally lost a few pounds and am back to my normal weight as I where post baby. The lines are so visible that I cannot not wear bra I can't wear anything which may reveal any part of my breasts. I went to see my surgeon again and he basically said I need to put some weight on which i have struggeled with all my life i am a perfect weight for my height and my doctors think the same !the surgeon said I look anorexic!! Which I think is a disgusting thing to say to someone as there are people who are suffering from this kind of thing. So I then left there feeling upset and cheated. I've spent 5000 pounds on something that I now hate and are seeing another surgeon to put them right. I think they should put on a time limit after just giving birth instead of just thinking about the money.

We rang when a couple of minutes away to explain the situation and were rudely told that we were now unable to be seen this evening. After trying to discuss a little further as our journey had now taken over 2 hours there was no empathy, we were offered to sit and wait to see if there was a cancellation. On arrival at 6pm we told them we would wait to see if there was a cancellation and they said we could go to the high street, they would call us at 19.10 exactly if we were to be seen. Knowing how prompt they are we proceeded to the car at 19.11 and started our journey home. At 19.22 they rang to explain that someone had not turned up and we were abruptly told we had 3 minutes to get back there if we wanted to be seen. We mentioned that we thought we would have been called at 19.10 and the lady said they held on a little longer for the client. How is it we were a few minutes late and not seen but it's okay for them to call us late. To summarise there purpose and company values are a fraud. We were paying cash for a cosmetic procedure, not only have they lost our business they also had a no show appointment. It is clear that the main value is going home early.

I didn't want to rush into anything so i thought about it for another 6 months before going for another consultation with the surgeon. MYA were very understanding and didn't rush my decision. I finally booked in for surgery in April this year and had the procedure done on the 21st June. When I went to Preston for the procedure the staff were excellent, I couldn't fault them.

I was expecting to be in alot of pain and the nurse had given me alot of painkillers but I only had 2 on the second day after the operation and then I didn't use them. It was more uncomfortable than painful. I would say my sore throat and the swelling were the worst parts about it. I've had various appointments post op with the nurse since and again she was lovely.

On my first meeting with Dr Frati, I was nervous, I didn't know what to expect or what he would say. I was worried that I wouldn't be able to go ahead with what I wanted, because obviously he wouldnt do anything ridiculous or stupid.

MYA Cosmetic Surgery,direct,angela asquith,2016-05-18T23:58:47Z,5  stars,MYA professional Trustworthy and well worth the money.,"After years of wanting my nose fixing and quite a few visits to various other cosmetic companies I visited MYA and decided to go ahead with them. From the very beginning everyone who I came into  contact with was very polite and friendly. The staff make you feel very welcome and I really liked the non-clinical friendly warm feeling. I decided to have my surgery with Dr.Andrea Giannitrapani  ( I might have spelt his name incorrectly) as he was recommended for what kind of surgery I needed. On meeting the surgeon I found him very nice and he actually listened. I visited other companies and their surgeons were the ones that put me off using them, despite the lower price, it is about feeling comfortable and happy not price. I felt it was important that I got the right feeling from the whole experience and all the staff and MYA gave me this. I had my operation at Preston First Trust Hospital which has a hotel near by where my husband and I stayed the night before. When you have the operation you have to have a chaperone with you. The staff at First Trust were all absolutely great. The nurses are lovely I can not fault any aspect of my visit at all. Even the anaesthetist came and shook my hand and introduced himself. I was so nervous but they really did their best to make me feel at ease. Afterwards Dr.Andrea came to the room I was in and was showing my husband his work and saying how happy he was with the result. I was allowed to leave after a few hours and I went home.  I am currently 8 days post operation and I still have the splint on. I can already see the difference although it is important to be honest with yourself and not expect to see true results for up to a year. Having realistic expectations and knowing how long healing takes is important. I have had a  minimum amount of pain and I am happy with the service MYA has provided me with. The girls call on a regular basis to see how I am and even drop me emails.  My instagram is anjs_rhinoplasty if anyone would like to see my journey and images.

I can honestly say from start fo finish that I was super impressed with them.  From my Patient Coordinator through to my surgeon (Mr Marcellino), the staff on the ward when I went in for my operation and the nurses I met with for my post-op check ups were absolutely fantastic!  My original PC left the organisation but my case was passed to an equally super PC (Cassandra). I never felt rushed or pressured (there was no hard sell).  I asked to meet with more than one surgeon before making my final decision and I was super happy to be able to select Mr Marcellino.  His bedside manner was amazing and I immediately felt comfortable and secure with him.  He truly listened to what I wanted to achieve and was very honest and open about what to expect and what could be delivered.  Looking as natural as possible is very important to me and I was able to have a mastopexy without implants and now, six months now since my surgery, I cannot even begin to tell you how satisfied I am with the results.  I had the surgery purely for myself to feel more physically comfortable but even my better half, who was very sceptical about my doing this in the first instance, was impressed both with MYA and their ethics as well as Mr Marcellino's work.

Communication was good, so I knew what to expect at each stage & the pre-op info that the Leeds Clinc  provided was very thorough & calmed me last night when I wanted to check something. Had surgery at First Trust in Preston yesterday morning, and couldn't fault the hospital one bit. It's easy to find, very private and feels like a hotel.

Girls At front of house where very helpful and easy to get an appointment with - especially Becky. Happy with my surgeon (mr frati) surgery went well nurses very caring although a very rude anesthetist. I do however have what I would call unsatisfactory results. Aftercare had originally been going very well but as time has gone on this has been neglected particularly by PCs - I don't actually know who mine is. It does feel as though any issues will be pushed back as much as possible and that you will need to jump through a lot of hoops for any resolution if a problem does arise. Booking an appointment now post op has take several weeks of calls and ignored emails for someone to confirm a date and the appointment is scheduled in for nearly three weeks away which would not have been a problem at the beginning as a new patient. Overall I would use Mya again mainly as I would want me frati to be my surgeon.

Even after changing my mind alot of times! Got a late appointment so didnt have to wait very long on that side. Admission time was 8am however I didnt get seen until 4:30 because of two major cases, so a later admission time would have been better. Nurses and surgeon at hospital were professional after my surgery.  For my 7 day post op check up I turned up and the nurse had gone home thinking she had no more appointments. I showed my email of confirmation and the girl on the desk was very apologetic. I rearranged for two days later, not sure if the nurse was aware but no apologies for the missed appointment.. Considering they take �50 off patients for missed app's, I would atleast expect an apology for them missing mine! The nurse was good at the check up anyway, put my mind at ease about pain etc. Overall a good experience, i am happy with the results. Excited to see how they change from 11 days post op onwards. Only thing I'd say is to ring to confirm your appointments even if received an email.",Positive,0.7657,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,time,professional,pain,0,0,happy,results

I now have confidence, feel sexy, womanly, I can't wait for my next holiday and to get in a bikini which I've NEVER looked forward to! Always spending upwards to �100 for expensive padded bikinis, now I can wear anything. Not only that, I can buy any dress I want, no more searching for something that covers bra straps or sewing panels in to cover my bra. I was completely flat chested at a curvy/athletic 5 foot 10, it's never matched me! Dr kazazzi knew exactly what I wanted, I even had my doubts and asked to go bigger but he insisted I stick with his suggestion. I didn't want to go too big and now no one assumes I've had a boob job, mainly because I always wore padded bras. Even my mum doesn't think I was as flat chested as I was. And that's exactly how I like it. theyre so natural looking and I can still wear all my clothes I still have. Anyway...enough about how I feel...the nottingham and Doncaster clinics were fantastic. The only negative I have for nottingham is they regularly ran over schedule, I was once a waiting nearly 3 hours for my appointment even though I arrived on time. A courtesy call would've been helpful. But the good far out weighs the bad, hence 5 stars! The surgery itself was pain free, I had no pain killers and remained that way throughout my recovery :) I know not everyone is that lucky. I look at them every day and can't believe I finally took the plunge after 12 years of wanting it done and thinking about it every single day...there wasn't a day that went by I didn't catch a glimpse of myself in a mirror and think I hated it. It didn't get me down but it was a constant worry, now I'm so much more confident. Can't wait to start running again, been back in the gym most days since my 6 week sign off, just need to book a holiday now.

We tried on various different implants to suit exactly what I wanted. Fay was absolutely brilliant and so friendly! Mr max marcellino was just as brilliant, unlike some surgeons he really listens to exactly what kind of breasts you want, and then helps you decide exact implant for you. I didn't want to go too big I wanted to be a nice natural D-DD. Without a fake looking profile. However the implants I chose originally he was advising me to go just tha little bit bigger. So after a couple of weeks of thinking about it I decided to go back into Bristol clinic and see him again, he was so much help and takes his time. You don't feel rushed. On the day of my op everybody at the mya hospital in London was brilliant from the minute I got there to the moment I left. I got there at 10:30 am and was on the operating table at 12:55.

I think its disgraceful he doesn't explain what he is doing, and I told him numerous times throughout the examination i was in a lot of pain, and only when I started crying did he stop. I appreciate he is trying to assist with any problems before they become major concerns, but to not be informed or have any explanation is disconcerting.

I attended my pre op my nurse angie was lovely. She made me feel very welcome, such a lovely lady. 3rd November 2015, I chose to go to the first trust hospital in Preston. I arrived at 8am, staff were amazing, shown to my room,  and popped the tele on. Before I knew it dr Andrea came round to draw on me and take pics. Me and my husband were just relaxing till the time came. The nurse came in to do check ups, blood pressure etc. Then the anaesthetist came round I knew it was alsmost time. So excited. Then I walked down into surgery and it started. I woke up thinking where the hell am I. What's happened haha, once I came round I realised what I had done and was so excited to see. I looked down although I was slightly covered up I could see a massive  difference. The nurse was in every hour checking up on me, offering me tea and toast, there service was second to none. Fantastic hospital with wonderful staff. My post op appointments all went well. 9/10 i got seen to on time. I saw my surgeon twice in in the 1st 5 weeks as I was going abroad. So he gave me some advice. Overall I am pleased with everything. From my consultation, pre op, actual op, post op meetings. Everything went smoothly. Staff at Birmingham clinic are lovely.

MYA Cosmetic Surgery,direct,Megan,2016-01-11T17:00:55Z,1  stars,Disgusting Aftercare - MYA Chelmsford,"After being treated like royalty in my initial consultation, i felt MYA was the best place for surgery and booked to have the procedure in December 2013. Swiftly after parting with �4500, the contact between MYA and myself became non existent until my surgery date. When attending my aftercare appointments with Dr Fratti, i could be sat in the waiting room for 4 hours past my appointment time. Having traveled for an hour to get there you can only imagine my frustration. After experiencing problems and pain in my left breast, i went back to the surgery (of course Dr Fratti was not running on time with appointments). I was informed that one breast had encapsulated, and the other done the opposite which meant i had one rock solid breast and another that flopped like jelly when i laid down and twisted inside me any time I moved. After having to push for both breasts to be re-done as apparently only the encapsulated one qualified, i had my second surgery in May 2015. I was due to arrive at Fitzroy London at 12pm, so that i did. Dr Fratti obviously decided to have a lay in that day as he also arrived at 12pm, meaning he has missed all of his appointments waiting there since 6am. I did not go down for surgery until 8pm after not having eaten or had a drop of water for over 24 hours - the excuses from the staff were unbelievable. I finally left Fitzroy at 3am the next morning, and was not even offered an overnight stay despite the fact i was very unwell and non-coherent. i have so far been seen for my one week check up, 8 week check up, and am currently still waiting to be seen for my 3 month check up 8 months down the line. Although initial appointments with MYA Chelmsford seem great - please be warned that the aftercare is the complete opposite, and once you have parted with your money - you are just another body on the operating table!

MYA Cosmetic Surgery,direct,carolyn oneill,2015-12-03T22:18:59Z,1  stars,Be careful,"My daughter had implants about 9 months ago. The pre surgery process  could not have been better. The coordinator  was fantastic. My daughter looked into everything that could go wrong and made sure that everything was covered, or so she thought, eveb though MYA was more expensive thet seemed to be the best place to go to. After the surgery all seemed great then she the implants started getting painful and harden.  She went back to see Mr Fratti who 'cracked' her boobs. She had hard scar tissue and that was causing the problems. She had them cracked again. This is quite a painful thing to have done. Her boobs have to be squeezed, if that is the correct term, quite forcefully to break down the scar tissue. She is unable to lay on her front, cuddle her son  and maasaging them to try to stop the scar tissue formimg is very  painful  but she does this regularly as instructed. Her boobs are still hard and painful and the left one has now dropped an inch lower than the right. She knew that she was insured for capsular contracture,  which is what this is and so  6 weeks ago she again contacted them to see Mr Fratti  again as the pain is bad to see what could be done.  She finally got to see him today after phoning anumber of times and noy being phoned back, quite a difference to pre surgery but they had not had her �5000 then..... She  was told today that her capsular  contracture  is stage 2 and they would not do a reop unless it got to stage3 even though she is in a lot of pain. They have given her medication and told her to go back in 3 months. She was also told that one boob was lower than the other before her  operation  and that is why it is lower now, but it has only dropped in the last couple of weeks and to be honest it didnt look lower before the operation and this was never mentioned in her pre op consultation.. We are now waiting to see what happens in the next 3 months but she is not very hopeful. If it does not progress to stage 3 does that mean she has to live in pain with hard implants. She asked all the questions that she thought she needed to. She looked into everything that could go wrong. She could not have done much more. If she had been told that one boob would be lower than the other she would have thought about having an augmentation as well although to be honest I dont think she had enough  boob for one of them to be that much lower. The photos that she had done did not show  this.  My advice is to be very careful as even though they say they insure against capsular  contracture  you may still not be covered. They are brilliant before the procedure but for us they dont seem to care that she is having problems and it took quite a few calls for them to arrange for her to be seen. They kept saying we will call you back and then not phoning. Perhaps it is not worth paying the extra for peace of mind if it doesnt mean anything. If all goes well with no problems they are good but if you have problems.................",Negative,-0.991,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,expensive,time,care,painful,0,0,0,0

I had a breast augmentation and uplift with MYA almost two years ago and the surgery was fine but less than a year after my procedure I started to have some problems. I went to them straight away with my concerns but of course, as I have already had the procedure and paid they don't care. My calls were rarely answered and when they were, I was treated so terribly - the staff were rude and don't appreciate your time. I have had a string of appointments that 'haven't been booked' when I've turned up and emails that 'have been sent' but I've 'missed' them but miraculously appear in my inbox after I have complained. When I eventually managed to get an appointment, I am told a different piece of information and then given a timeframe to wait which is usually about a month or two and that quickly adds up when you count all of the mistakes made. It seems like the staff and surgeon are not on the same page and the staff need to be trained on what the procedures are as well as an intensive course on customer service. I won't even touch upon the amount of time you have to wait for your appointment as the surgeon is often running 2 hours behind. It has taken almost a further year to get some sort of resolution and I use the word resolution extremely lightly. Since I have had an issue, it's been a constant struggle to get any kind of answer from anybody and when I said I would like to make a complaint I was urged not to as it would slow down the process - this has been ongoing since January. I am utterly fed up with this company and have been in talks with press and PR about how I have been treated. I would urge people to tread with caution before going with them. I thoroughly regret my decision and I will have to go elsewhere to get the help I need.",Negative,-0.6921,Breast Augmentation,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,quick,staff,0,0,0,0,0

I had a consultation at Leeds and I was relaxed and it wasn't like Harley medical at all . I was under a no obligation to book and even got a change to see and feel different implants. A week or so later I booked my op. The day of my op I was treat like a vip in a beautiful private hospital in Preston. I was fully aware what time I would be going down to theatre and kept very comfortable. At 1pm I went down and was surprised to be back awake before 2Pm . At 5pm I managed to eat and was told I could leave . I didn't have any initial pain and pain 2-7 days later was bearable actually. The aftercare was fantastic and my boobs have made me so confident .

MYA Cosmetic Surgery,direct,leila rae,2015-05-07T13:00:59Z,1  stars,What aftercare???,"I went in for a breast re-aug 2012 and was told by the pc that they're silicone implants were guaranteed not to ripple!! I was also told by the surgeon that rippling or sagging would happen later on nearer the time to replacing them but not immediately. The strapping came off and there were big ripples all over the breasts, i complained to the surgeon and was told to put weight on take vitamin e tablets and go home and pray! months went by of me constantly trying to get an appointment, talk over issues etc but the staff were extremely rude putting the phone down on me not replying to emails and not calling me back. after a few more months of waiting, the rippling got worse and both breasts were uneven i could no longer get through to MYA so i had to ring several other MYA clinics to talk to someone, I live in London and should have been talking to someone in London instead I found myself ringing cardiff birmingham and wherever else I could. I told my surgeon i was a runner and did not want the boobs to affect my active lifestyle he assured me I would be able to get back to the gym within a few weeks but I was never able to, i was in constant pain and could hardly walk without pain, i continued to complain to MYA about my concerns and was always fobbed off. About 10 months ago I started getting pains in my shoulder, it progressed so much that I am now on muscle relaxants. My physiotherapist said it was due to the heavy implants that my posture had changed causing spasms in my shoulder blade. I initially asked for higher rounder fuller breasts and was given 700cc, I had no idea about sizes silicone etc, but the surgeon did. I now have two big dents in both breasts and am sure I am bottoming out, i saw the revision surgeon who confirmed this but my own surgeon said I am not bottoming out and its extra skin and that i need smaller implants and an uplift! As a surgeon I would have thought he would have recognised that the skin was sagging beforehand and that I would have needed an uplift as well as implants but instead he put big implants in me in hope that this would mask the problem. Now, I don't know if i'm bottoming out or if I need an uplift as both surgeons I have seen gave contradicting advice!! I am currently being told to wait, again, for a decision from head office on what the next step is, my options are go implant free for 6 months, have smaller implants wait 6 months with sagging skin and then have an uplift....number one my aftercare period will be finished by then and i would have to pay, number two i do not want smaller implants as small as he is offering to save his own skin, and number three i do not want two operations! if other people can have an uplift and implants done in one op why can't i? its all to do with the aftercare period...all this time they were telling me to wait to see how the breasts develop or that nothing was wrong was just their way of fobbing me off so that the aftercare period finishes and any other procedure i would need, i would have to pay again. I am totally disgusted, i have never had aftercare at all, i was even told that i could not have my pc's contact number and was rudely spoken to by most of the staff at MYA whenever i complained. I waited 6 months or more for an appointment with the revision surgeon and have been treated unfairly by everyone at MYA, I now have less confidence than before, I do not undress infront of my partner, I do not go out, I do not wear revealing clothes, I am embarrassed by my boobs because of the dents in them, i have to constantly re adjust them as one is bigger than the other and higher than the other and i get horrible comments from total strangers! all i wanted was a boob job for my own reasons this has been one big nightmare the staff are disgusting, the surgeons are liars and the company just want your money. i have asked for my aftercare to be reinstated as i have never received any from the start and also requested one op implant size of my own choice and for all of it to be free of charge as i have already paid for something that has made me unhappier than before. the aftercare is supposed to cover the initial look and i hate the way they are so why shouldn't it be free? if i had been told i need an uplift in the beginning i would have been happy to pay but i do not have the money and i will not put myself in debt to put right what the surgeon has done wrong, they have fobbed me off by saying that my skin quality is poor, well as a surgeon whose been doing this for years, shouldn't you have seen this and advised me about it? whether its sagging skin or bottoming out, too big implants or too small etc, it should be fixed without question as this is what we pay for! calls emails queries complaints worries nursing issues etc are all part of aftercare and i have not had any! i have every email i have sent and made a note of all calls etc so if they think they can tell me i have had aftercare they are wrong!! i would never recommend MYA to anyone, they do not care about you after you hand the money over and whatever problems you have they laugh...literally. they fob you off and tell you they were busy with calls etc but after sitting and listening to the staff gossip about patients etc while the phones are ringing i do not believe they do their job properly, if talking about what you're having for lunch to someone on the phone whilst other patients are trying to get through is deemed as professional then i am shocked!! i wish i never chose MYA and i would warn everyone else against going there for any procedure.",Negative,-0.9902,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,charge,time,professional,pain,0,0,happy,0

MYA Cosmetic Surgery,direct,Sherrie,2015-05-06T21:05:59Z,1  stars,Had a boob job and had them removed it's a no go people,"My honest experience I will be totally honest! Had implants 300cc sept 2014 was told they could cut my implants in half and they wouldn't leak ect ect found out after my implants from the paper work I did not get those implants. Putting that side I was so ill and my hair was falling out. MYA advised me my fatigue, shaking, memory loss, vision loss and balance as not due to the implants and I had a thyroid problem, I went to my doctors one of many many times during this horrible time if my life to be told after blood tests I did not have a thyroid problem so I ring mya and told them I did not. They then told me I had heart problems and it wasn't the implants so I went to docs and had an ECG to check my heart and that also came back clear, I went to get my eyes tested and got told I needed glasses fjr the first time in my life. In the end my doctor demanded mya take my implants out after 4 months of suffering, they listened to my doctor but not me, I had been asking for them out for 4 months prior to the doctors orders. Anyway 3 days later they was out and my illnesses have gone and after an eye site test magically I no longer need glasses coincidence?! I don't think so. Anyway after removal I asked for my implants as they are my property, I was told it's against the dept of health law that I receive my implants. I thought this was weird so I emailed the dept of health and got the reply that my implants are my property and I am entitled to them. This lead me to believe my implants may have been ruptured hense why I was so poorly. I complained to mya who sent me a reply basically suing I'm strange for asking for my implants in the 1st place but with no apologies for what has happened or nothing to compensate all the travelling I had to do when I was poorly demanding them to listen to me. I'm now left with a 4000 bill and scars. Please if you are considering this you need to really think if your health and your body is perfect as it is trust me I know. And please do not use mya at all.

A year ago I had vaser lipo on my flanks and outer thighs and was pretty happy with the result. On my 6 month post-op, I discussed with Dr Traynor (AMAZING) that I still felt more could've been taken out. We came up with a plan together and he was very willing to help sort this problem out for me. He was very honest throughout the procedure and I have another meeting 12 months post op to see how I am feeling about the results. Brilliant service. My nurses appointments were chopped and changed a bit however I was seen more often due to missing certain specific days (3 day post op, became 5 day) but I saw them regularly over the first two weeks. Although the procedures are a lot money (they are competitively priced) I would definitely recommend MYA from my overall service. The twitter service regularly keep in contact with me and when I tweeted that I'd fallen at the beginning and hurt myself, they took the time out to get in contact, ensuring that I was ok and could anything be done if it wasn't. In addition on the day I was nervous about the anaesthetic but the anaesthetist that came round was very reassuring, took the time out to to discuss my feelings and made sure I was calmed before going in - definitely not a rushed service. Dr Traynor himself had music playing from an iPod as I went in to calm me again! After the operation my mum was panicking that my blood sugars were low but the girls were very quick to help, one even giving me some of her lunch to ensure that I was fine! Although some reviews suggest MYA is all about breast augmentation, I appreciate this is their main operation but I definitely didn't feel second best because I was having a different op.

All my questions were answered very clearly and the staff were always happy to answer any of my queries however silly they sounded. Before deciding to go with MYA I shoped around elsewhere just to see where I felt most comfortable and even though I I was quoted a bit cheaper elsewhere but I just loved how mya made me feel compared to the other places that where unprofessional and pushy! I knew after that that I would go with MYA and I booked my surgery for a month and a half later in between that time I had a consultation with my surgeon Dr Frati who was highly recommended by many people he isn't the most talkative but he really knows what he's doing, after my consultation with him I met my nurse two weeks later who was lovely and talked me through the process and took pictures for my profile. On the day of my surgeryI met my nurse for the day who was AMAZING her name was Summa and was always checking up on me and she was so lovely and talkative and was always in a great mood which is what you need nothing worse than miserable people. Then I met my anaesthetist who really put me at ease bAring in mind ive never been put to sleep he made me feel in safe hands and was having a real good laugh with me before I went in! And then off course I met Dr Frati again just to go over my chosen size etc. After the surgery I was recovering in my room which was so clean and lovely with a TV!!

And my patient coordinator also suggested ordering two sizes of implants to come on the day as i was having trouble choosing and when i got there only one size had been ordered so i had to just go with them. And second applying for the loan was unnecessarily hard, as i wanted to pay on two cards, part debit and part credit, which wasn't allowed. And so my mum said she would help me out and pay for it on her card but then couldn't because the loan was in my name, and it was her name on the card, which just caused unnecessary stress. Other than that i enjoyed my experience with Mya, everyone was so nice and very efficient and the hospital i went to on the day was very posh.

First one went really well, they make you feel so comfortable, Kim the clinic manager, she was just amazing! So then I went back and thought on it again for a few months, still going on mya'a website probably every week!! After discussing it with my partner, we decided I should just go for it!! So I did, with out hesitation I booked in for my meeting with the amazing dr mounir!! And my pre op all on the same day. I couldn't recommend dr mounir enough, he was just fantastic, he has got all the time in the world for you, he goes into every last detail with you so you have all the information you need and are at full understanding on what will happen. I then paid in full for my op and went for the soonest date they had...3 weeks away, I'd prepared my self for a very long time so wasn't nervous at all, until I got to the hospital in Preston, nerves kicked in!! All the nurses was caring and couldn't do enough for you, then dr mounir came into the room and went through every thing again, still making sure I'm happy with every thing, which of course I was!! The anaesthetist explained what he was to do, also made me feel at ease. Then it was time to go in, they took me into theatre, put the needle into my hand and the anaesthetic, the nurse and anaesthetist was having general conversation with me about my kids and the next thing I know, I woke up with breast!! Everything was over and done with in a flash, I was dis charged in no time, the nurses checked my blood pressure a few times. Gave me pain relief all my paper work and off I went. Since then Iv had phone calls to see if every things ok, after care is brilliant, I have my post op in a few days!! I feel great!! Not much pain either, just limited to what I can do.

When i turned 21 i decided it was something that would definitely change my life for the better. I went to the Leeds clinic in November and they didn't push me into anything, in fact, they didn't sell me a fairytale or make me promises that would make me sign up there and then. After my two week cooling off period i decided i needed more time. After a month of consideration i booked and had my surgery on the 5th of February with Mark Solomos at the Highgate hospital. My admission into the hospital was great, I was given privacy to prepare for the surgery and was told everything i needed to know, and staff were happy to answer any questions. My aftercare has been amazing and I am unbelievably happy with the result of my nose job- i'm in love with my new cute little nose.

Ladies if you are thinking about getting a breast augmentation please go to transform. Around the same price and the aftercare is 100x better. I've recently had breast implants with harley medical group and I definitely wouldn't recommend. Transform do yearly check ups and lots more included. I am only insured for 2 years with harley medical group where as you can get insured with transform for 10 years! Also when you book your first consultation, HMG want a deposit before you meet with the surgeon.. Transform don't take any money off you and book in with the surgeon so you can get an idea of what your outcome will be. My surgeon didn't show me any before or after pictures of what he done and when I asked the nurse if I could see any they told me it wasn't allowed therefore I went with a surgeon that I didn't know anything about. Please please please choose another company when you are going for your breast augmentation, harley medical group do not care about you and everything is so rushed and they are just after your money. This was my first time getting breast implants and no one I know has them so I was clueless, yet they didn't give me much information. I went into surgery not knowing what my breasts would look like afterwards as I wasn't explained this!!! I have 2 different sized breasts and my surgeon said he would put 2 different sized implants in (which he did). After surgery my breasts are completely different and my surgeon basically told me that was always going to the outcome. I wish so much that he had told me this before surgery because I definitely wouldn't have gone ahead with it!!! I'm left with breasts that I hate more now than I did before surgery. He now has recommended getting a lift to make them symmetrical but again I wish he had recommended this before surgery. Being a first time breast augementation patient I thought that implants were the answer to symmetrical breasts. I explained so many times that my reason for getting breasts implants was to make my breasts symmetrical so why am I left with 2 obvious different sized breasts aand not explained the differences that i would still have after surgery.

They consoled me when my original surgery date was cancelled and supported me all the way up to my revision date. They explained the procedure, the risks and gave me advice on how to manage my BP but also my mind to relax and look beyond the surgery ... to something I wanted and the results that I will have. 3 months after my original surgery date I was ready and it couldn't have gone any better. I'm now just under 2 weeks post op and my healing is going well. The results so far (remember I'm still swollen) are amazing and I am now being very impatient with myself to see the final results. I can't thank the team enough ... I truly believe that love the jobs and helping people achieve what they want. Mark Solomos ... no words can express how grateful I am, he will always have a special place in my heart! The team at the Highgate hospital ... the same ... they truly care. Thuli, Roberto are two of the nicest people I have ever met in my life ... they remembered me from 3 months previous which eased my anxiety on the day but also expresses their love for their jobs and also their patients. I could go on and on about the support but I think from this small acknowledgement you can see that I can't recommend the Harley Medical Group more highly. The reason for the 9 score and not a 10 is down to a few little things: 1. I had to chase my admission time for surgery... this didn't come till the day before surgery 2. I had no follow up call post surgery / return home as a duty of care.

From my initial consultation with Deborah Rea my Surgical Counsellor it was the most positive journey.  Deborah talked me through all the options available to me, including sharing her own experience of the surgery i was after which was so helpful and reassuring for me.  She recommended a great surgeon Mr Mark Solomos who was able to carry out both procedures in the same surgery.  Following on from this I met with a nurse Nicola Hague in Manchester several times who was lovely and again reassuring to do my pre-operative checks.  I then went to visit Mr Solomos at the Harley Street clinic.  He was very honest and practical about what we could achieve and left me positive and ready to take the next steps.  The surgery itself took place with Mr Solomos and a great team at the Highgate Hospital, London.  All the staff were really friendly and positive and put me at ease.  I have never had surgery before so was a little daunted but i felt comfortable and confident in the outcome.  I was made to feel very at ease, I met with Mr Solomos on the morning of surgery and i recall him saying ""Oh you are going to be so happy"", how exciting for me, even when it came to going down for surgery the team were chatty, making me laugh, keeping me relaxed.  I had the surgery and once i came round from the anaesthetic the nursing staff were amazing looking after me, special mention to Joanna, Magda and Alma all lovely ladies who really looked after me.  Once i was home I had an appointment a week after surgery at the Manchester clinic and met with Andrea Ingham Lead Nurse, what a fantastic lady.  She really looked after me and made me feel reassured of how my recovery was going well and kept me positive.  She changed all my dressings, removed staples from my tummy tuck and took care to make sure I wasn?��t in pain as she did it.  I had several follow up appointments with Andrea to check my recovery and change the dressings, she was consistently lovely and supportive.  Now all that remains is for me to have my last appointment with Mr Solomos to review the results when I am six weeks post surgery.  I cannot recommend Harley Medical Group highly enough and Mark Solomos as a surgeon, he has done an incredible job and transformed me completely, no regrets and I?��m so happy.",Positive,0.9986,Breast Uplift,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Transform,0,time,staff,pain,0,0,helpful,results

On my second session I booked again with Nadia again I got a call from the Manchester office, the lady stated the microneedling machine had not been serviced so my appointment was to be cancelled, this bearing in mind this is a day prior to my appointment , and I had booked a babysitter aswel, this i found very unprofessional how can a machine not have been serviced and only notice a day before. I was really annoyed with the service, I said I would call back to book again which I did I called head office arranged another appointment with Nadia, I further stated please assure it is not rearranged or cancelled and or booked with another person, I spoke to a lovely gentleman (Chad) at the head office and he assured me I would be seeing Nadia. A couple of days before my appointment I again got a call from the Manchester office again saying my appointment has been cancelled due to unforeseen circumstances, I was very upset as I had now missed 2 months of treatment,. I then rang the head office (HR) again, I requested for Nadia and they said it was confirmed to be with Nadia, I then attended my appointment at the Harley medical group (Manchester) I called in to say I was running late due to traffic, Zoe answered and replied no problem I will see you shortly. I was abit surprised because my appointment was booked with Nadia, this was the fourth time and I had enough., I did not understand why my appointment could not be with the person I requested (Nadia) I went in to the clinic and spoke to Zoe myself and told her my appointment had been booked with Nadia and she said it was totally fine. I don't know why this couldn't have been clarified months ago, I'm sure it was embarrassing for Zoe and myself which caused me a lot of upset and anxiety due to which I had to take my inhaler as I was out of breath and  reiterating what I have been for the past 5/6 months. I finally got to see Nadia, she firstly apologised for any convenience caused and asked me to take a seat as I was out of breath and told me to take deep breaths and to take my inhaler.

I was told my deposit of �500 would be returned in 28 days. I have had to chase this and was told it would come in a cheque. I was told they do not pay direct into people?��s bank for data protection. If they can quickly take and ask money off a client and do that via bacs etc why can?��t they do that in return.

Only result was just a smaller broad flat nose and a huge loss of money for me. I asked from the start of my journey for a sharp define tip n slim nose (bridge) after 2 surgeries you would expect that. i have other mixrace and afro carribean friends who had 1 surgeon 1 surgery and there nose is perfect after 1 year- besides staff being nice and trying their best...i still havent gained confidence and feel a wasted 3.5 years and have to contour my nose to hide the fact it doesnt look how it was meant to.Thank you x",Positive,0.1615,Rhinoplasty,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,time,staff,0,0,0,thank you,results

Yes, Mark does come across quite bluntly in appointments, and perhaps doesn't have the best bedside manner, but trust me when I say that he has hands of magic! He has done thousands of these surgeries and the experience has paid off, because my new boobs are perfect! Not too big (I had two consultations with him and actually went down a size from the initial one, as I really did not want big boobs). They are so natural looking, and symmetrical. For a few weeks after surgery one of them was sitting a bit higher than the other, and was also noticeably bigger, but they have completely evened out and dropped and now three months later, I honestly could not be happier.

They were keen to take my money when I had my initial operation but now I am having complications they do not want to know. I am constantly being fobbed off, I'm so upset, hurt and worried as I still don't have answers. I have had numerous appointments with various members of staff, most of whom have not been able to answer my medical questions, I have been given incorrect advice and their internal communications within their offices is a joke, it is quite evident that the offices do not liaise with each other. The incorrect advice resulted in me missing an event which I have been training for since June last year when my mother passed away, I am totally devastated and they do not seem to care. Every member of Harley Medical knew my situation but despite this they gave me the wrong information. I am so upset and feel sick with the knowledge that I could have participated after all, I'll never get that opportunity back, words cannot express my loss.  After travelling to their Manchester office from London I was told, yet again, that my notes were archived and unavailable despite my first appointment 3 weeks ago.  No one seems to know what they're doing. They do not respond to my emails or calls. They have taken over �5,000 for an operation that is not going to go ahead. This is totally unacceptable, I want my money back and I will be making a full complaint. Do not use this company, even the surgeon I spoke to today admitted the way I have been treated is just not good enough, can you believe it? If their own staff think that then something is really wrong. More to the point I am still none the wiser as to what's happened or what can be done to make it right, they do not have any sense of urgency but why would they?

He was very dismissive and disagreed with everything that i said. Prior to meeting him, I met with a lady from their Wimbledon branch who agreed that there was still a bump and that if i'm not happy then the surgeon would be happy to help. I travelled over 2 hours to meet the surgeon and as you can probably gauge i was very upset and disappointed to have spent over �5000 and still not be happy with my nose. The surgeon was generally nice and polite, just felt that he couldn't be bothered to operate again as it's more hassle for him which is a shame. I feel that Harley Street shouldn't offer a 2 year cover if the surgeons are not happy to re-do or amend a procedure.

Not only does my nose look terrible from the outside, inside the septum is massively leaning over to one side, I struggle to breathe every single day and often have to use nasel sprays. I have a smell of rotten fish in my nose and I still have a stitch left in the bottom of my nose which if I tug I can feel pulling through to the other nostril. This stitch irritates my like crazy and I've often got my fingers up my nose scratching it which then leads to my fingers being covered in blood. I have a constant bunged up feeling but if I blow my nose nothing comes out. I'm always having to cough up thick green stuff that seems to be stuck behind my nose and at the back of my thoat. I also have a clear runny water that drips down my nose which I read can be the water surrounding your brain leaking down your nose. I even saw an article a few years ago which said that my surgeon had been banned from practicing in the UK after receiving so many complaints and being sued. Having surgery here was the worst decision ever, I've suffered for almost 10 years and currently saving up for the reconstructive surgery that I need to help me love a normal life that isn't dominated by my nose everyday. I spent another night crying about this which is what's lead me to leave this review. If you're thinking of getting rhinoplasty take the time to find a specialist and pay the money for it.

The Harley Medical Group,direct,Stephanie Zoe Howard,2017-06-16T15:42:55Z,1  stars,Very disappointed with results and 'professionalism',"Upon first impressions, Dr Allwin came across as very humble man. I had a deviated septum and also breathing problems through my left nostril. I had wanted my nose corrected for a long time. We agreed that he would perform septorhinoplasty, but that he could not guarantee that he could get my nose 100% straight. I went into the contract under the impression that if my nose wasn't as straight as I wanted it, I could have corrective surgery. With full trust, I had the surgery and was very disappointed with my results. My nose is still deviated and not as straight as I would have liked, and my nostrils are completely uneven. The tip of my nose is horrendous and I much preferred it before the surgery. My nose is straighter, but I haven't had many improvements with the breathing and the tip of my nose is completely messed up as well as my nostrils. When I had the post- op appointment, I told Dr Allwin I wasn't happy with my nose and he got the contract out in front of me and told me that we agreed he couldn't get it 100% straight. I was very disappointed with his reaction. He should have at least showed concern. I laughed and said to him that showing me that is like setting me up for failure. After this, he proceeded to 'show concern', although I didn't feel as though he was exactly showing concern at all since he should have done this before showing me the contract. I paid him that money if I am not happy with my nose I expect him to do his job as a surgeon and correct it. From my own observations, it was as though he was trying to make it very difficult for me to have corrective surgery. I do not believe that Dr Allwin is practising in good faith. The moment he showed me the contract I completely lost trust in him. I was very disappointed with my nose and reported him to the manager. The chaperone that was present with us denied any recollection that he had shown me the contract. I requested a meeting with the both of them but was refused seeing as I said I didn't want corrective surgery with that doctor. I do not recommend Dr Allwin at all, or the Harley Medical Group.",Positive,0.8919,Rhinoplasty,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,The Harley Medical Group,0,time,chap,0,0,0,happy,results

I underwent breast augmentation after being overly self conscious for many years about having practically no boobs! As a shapely woman I wanted the breast to match my physique. Upon discussing size I was unsure and was advised and ""tried on"" sizes to decide what size I should go for. We came to the conclusion of a D/ potential DD cup. Trying on the implant I felt it suited my shape perfectly and I looked to have a very full bust with a seriously promising cleavage something I'd longed for to make me feel more womanly and self confident. I couldn't wait to see how amazing they would look and how amazing I would feel. However following the surgery when I got home to reveal the results I was underwhelmed by the change... letting the result settle in and be swelling free left me even more disappointed. In comparison to the D/DD outcome expected i don't feel they look anything like the preop test we did and I have 0 cleavage which was the entire reason I forked out the money to undergo this surgery. I am so confused as to how and implant can look so different once placed in surgery I almost feel as though I didn't get what I asked or paid for at all.",Positive,0.9315,Breast Augmentation,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,wait,0,0,0,0,0,results

I had one originally slightly bigger and got told if I payed an extra �300 they'd be made the same size. For the first week they looked amazing very lifted and in a perfect position. When I went back for my first appointment after my op I took a photo of them to show them off all the replies told me how my left boob was bigger than the other, which I found funny because the right one was the bigger one to start off with that I'd been told would be evened out to match the left but the surgeon took too much out of the originally bigger one and made it smaller than the left one. After a few weeks they weren't evening out so I made an appointment with my surgeon who told me that they looked fine and that he did a very good job, which I don't disagree he was an amazing friendly surgeon but it is no where near good enough for the amount I paid. He also went on to tell me how they would become the same size which confused me, how can a boob shrink by itself or grow. And then continued to tell me that I should come back in 9 months. The left one is much heavier than the right and won't fit evenly in a bra I have new stretch marks where the breasts have dropped ridiculous amounts and the scaring under the left breast is double the size of the right and is also stretching onto the unscarred skin. It is extremely painful I've been to the hospital for scans and also made another consultation with Harbour Private Hospital to over look the work I have had done at Harley medical I have told everyone I know NOT to come to this surgery I've also been told by a couple people that have also been with Harley that they weren't happy with there surgery either. It angers me to think it's been 6 months since my op the scaring has hardly changed and I will not be able to show them off in a bikini this summer like I planned if I could go back in time I'd have gone somewhere else.

The Harley Medical Group,direct,Angela Wilkinson,2016-12-13T14:14:13Z,3  stars,Impossible to book appointments,I go to HMG for laser treatments and in the past it has always been easy to get appointments and they are usually very flexible with changing them.  Over the past 6 months it has become increasingly difficult to book appointments - the evening and weekend appointments fill up really far in advance which actually makes it impossible to stick to the 6 week time frame between treatments when having a new area treated.  They desperately need to get more staff and more evening and weekend appointment slots!  I definitely wouldn't recommend HMG to anyone who has a busy lifestyle and needs flexibility with their appointments.  It also doesn't feel like great value for money because it's so expense.  The fact that they could offer packages at 50% off for their version of a black friday event just goes to show how much mark up they are applying on the cost!

I was early and I was quite happy to wait . First off the practitioner , in this case, Monica El-Meady stood in the middle of the reception area saying hello five times without saying who she was talking to until I  looked up said hi cause I thought she was just greeting when in actual fact she was talking to me and proceeded then say yes I am talking to you. She also turned around to a clients wife and said "" and who are You?"" We then went to the treatment room and I was told to sit. I did so and was asked the usual questions and signed the document as usual. I was then told to get  on the bed and I was given the goggles which were not fixed properly and she insisted when I told her that she said that as long as my eyes were shut the laser was safe needless to.say the goggles slipped and I have had laser before and I have never seen the laser but this time the I could see the laser flashing only to be told that I was ""seeing it with my nervous system "" which by the way is only possible if they were actually working on my nerves.  Then as she was was working on my jawline and  actually pushed the laser device into my jaw  bone. It was very painful and I asked her to stop. She just cranked up the laser. And it was very painful and she just carried on. After all this she then decided to, without actually asking.me , put  on one of the makeup products which has now resulted in a acne breakout on my face. She also decided it was a good idea to slap down the tube of product in front of me and lecture me on how to use SPF . I am well aware of what SPF is astill I am a south African and we get a lot more UV there than here. I felt like I was being rushed and I actually felt humiliated and somewhat violated. I usually have good service from this branch . I wasn't even offered a drink ofor water or tea or really anything.I don't care how.much experience you have in your field if you want tokeep.your clients then you should.listen to them.

I asked, if I needed less than 4 treatments for my upper lip, would I be able to get a refund on unused sessions and was advised that it wouldn't be worth it as they would charge me the standard rate for each session used, so I might as well use remaining sessions on another part of my body and was advised that yes, that would be possible. I was told this by the clinic manager, and at no point did she indicate that I would need at least 4 sessions to treat my upper lip. The treatments commenced, the first of which was by a trainee but overseen by the clinic manager. After the second treatment I commented that there was little visible reduction in the hair, and also that they seemed to be concentrating on a small area, and I was concerned that the 4 sessions wouldn't be adequate to cover the whole area. I was told not to worry but the lady carrying out the treatment turned up the strength of the laser. After the last session I once again expressed that I was disappointed that there were still many hairs visible and some on the areas that had been done in the earlier sessions had grown back. I was then advised that they will grow back, particularly over time, and that this is dependent on hormones and individuals, and as I have dark hair (one of the reasons I wanted it removed in the first place!) this is more likely.

First appointment was great,  felt happy with what I was going to have and took all information home with me. Decided to book and paid my deposit for the surgery date and pre op appointments. Assessments are a long travel just to be seen but seemed worth it to me. A week after paying the deposit my assessment appointment was changed from Bristol to London so alot longer journey. I decided to do it anyway. My pre op was still in birmingnam.  When I arrived I met another couple who were there for a post op appointment. She had the same op I was waiting for  (tummy tuck) and she said she was hugely disappointed and said she would never use them again.  I wish I had listened.  Hour wait for the appointment and the lady couldn't get any blood so was a wasted journey anyway. Had to rebook for another nurse to be there to help.  As the assessment had been moved it was now after the 31 day cut off to pay the balance. I paid this in full and set off to maidstone for my appointment very excited.  Long journey and overnight stay so more expense. Then told at the assessment by the surgeon I would need alot more work,  I explained I was only unhappy with my tummy he said he wanted to do the rest totally another  �7k or he wouldn't do it.  There was no way I had this money and would require two surgeries and work would never allow the time off.  Rang harley group who after a week of chasing accepted I could have a refund.  I was disappointed and out of pocket but was happy to be getting the money back. It took over a month to recieve the money!  I had to chase them everyday and they would only refund by cheque so even longer to get my money. Terrible customer service.

My breast was almost flat. But he chose for me a implant only 270cc. I didn't know anything, i felt it was small but he said if I choose bigger size so it will look very fake and he said my breast after surgery could be size c or d.. Although, i reminded him to make the gap between these breast very narrow. But the gap is very big now. I have been very disappointed after the surgery . The breast is too small than what I expected. Only size b cup. The gap between these breast is very  big. I trusted the doctor too much.

The Harley Medical Group,direct,A,2016-10-10T20:38:04Z,1  stars,Biggest mistake I have ever made,"After reading several bad reviews and then reading a few good ones I decided to give Harley medical Manchester benefit of the doubt which I deeply regret. I have wasted so much time and money. I could have spent the exact amount somewhere else and received the results I was promised. They are quick to book you for a in for a consultation and take the deposit but once the job is done they aren't interested. On the consultation we discussed my expectations and which product would give me the best results. I left happy and excited as I had wanted fuller lips for quite some time now. When I returned I saw a different nurse whose own lips didn't look great. I guess that was my warning sign but from the excitement I didn't notice at the time. I then had numbing cream applied, after around 20/30 minutes I was taken in to go over the paperwork. I showed the nurse a picture of some enhanced lips to give her and idea of what I was looking for. She then told me I would need a complete different product than to what was recommended. After that I told the nurse I wanted the 1ml filler in two sittings as I wanted to gradually build volume. She basically said I'd walk away with no difference if I had 0.5  today really pushing me into paying another 150 and get the full ml. I wasn't exactly happy with this but thinking she was the expert and I was in good hands I trusted what she had said. The nurse then left me for maximum five minutes so that I could read and sign the papers. By this time the numbing cream had worn off quite a bit. Anyway I signed and got into the chair. When she began injecting I felt so much pain. I'm quite a strong person but there were tears streaming from my eyes. I wasn't numb at all. After asking her to apply more cream I was told it wouldn't do anything at this point I decided to stay quiet as she seemed annoyed. So not only have I been rushed and pushed into paying more I now have to endure the pain also. After what felt like an eternity the torture finally ended. At this point I didn't even care what my lips looked like anymore I just wanted to go home. Fast forward I have been left with uneven and lumpy ugly lips, which has had a huge impact on my confidence. I have been back several times and only wasted my time and money becausr she cannot accept she has messed up. I believe the job was rushed. When I have showed her comparisons of other practioners she had the audacity to tell me their pictures are fake or that their work doesn't look good etc trying to cover her mess. I deeply regret trusting Harley medical and will never return. I will also ensure no other person makes the same mistake I have. Your practioners are inexperienced and need proper training. I am now going to someone who knows what they are doing and has plenty experience to back it to fix the ugly mess created by her. Do not trust these money hungry people. Once they take your money they lose interest. So many people had said this, I wish I had listened to my gut feeling.",Positive,0.4883,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,quick,person,pain,0,0,happy,results

I am pregnant and contacted the harley medical group. I was told by the patient advisor yes I could get a refund. They are unable to treat me but also refuse to give me a refund now. I paid �599 of which I feel like this company has ripped me off. Everytime I call to speak with someone no one is available to take call and in clinic. This is now going into the 2nd week now.

So imagine how disappointed I was to be told something tht feels like ive just wasted over a thousand pounds and a year of my life. I feel like ive hit a brick wall. I have been told I can look on internet to buy the product though itll be more expensive and Id have to make 2 visits to the clinic then....to have a patch test to determine tht the treatment will be safe. Then go for treatment 2 days later once patch test is ok.  How frustrating when ive been having the treatment over 12 months already with no problems.  It's not easy to get there.

The Harley Medical Group,direct,Charlotte Hall,2015-12-24T19:18:13Z,5  stars,Liposuction - great experience!,"I have recently had a brilliant experience with Harley Medical Group who performed traditional liposuction on four areas of my thighs.  I went for an initial consultation and spoke with nurse Cat who was totally awesome throughout. She said for the results I wanted I would need four areas - both sides, front and back of my thighs.  She offered me traditional and vaser options and didn't pressure me to take the vaser option (the more expensive option). I chose traditional because the only benefits I saw to vaser were recovery time and pain, which didn't really worry me. I was booked in for a consultation with my surgeon Mr Allwin Gnanajebamani who was lovely. He listened to what I wanted and made the same recommendation as Cat did - four areas of lipo all around my thighs, except he swapped back of thighs for side of knees.  I was told I would have to stay in overnight as four areas is a bit hardcore so I paid the extra for that (approx. �300 if I remember correctly) and was VERY glad I did as I feel I needed that in hindsight after the surgery.  I had my appointments for swabs with Cat which all went fine.  I had some questions in the run up to the surgery which Cat answered over the phone and e-mail very promptly.  She always made me feel very at ease.  I went to Highgate Hospital which was nicer than almost all the hotels I've ever paid to stay in by a long way.  The staff were all incredibly friendly - they made me feel very at ease and answered all of my questions.  Nothing was too much trouble and they explained everything.  The food was lovely and they came very quickly when I rang for them.  I went down for the surgery and woke up in my pressure garment feeling sleepy and sore but they helped to manage my pain so I felt very comfortable.  My overnight stay and check out with meds all went very well, no problems.  Went for my follow up with Cat who removed my dressings and checked my stitches.  I am now almost 3 months post surgery and can see the shape I think my thighs will be (for the most part, although they say another 3 months for final result) and am deliriously happy.  I have had the equivalent of a Coke bottle of fat/liquid removed from each thigh and the difference is striking.  Allwin told me there maybe unevenness to my skin surface afterwards, as skin isn't perfectly smooth and although I do notice this in places, my legs are slim now so I don't care!  And it may still reduce with time to settle.  My advice would be to anyone who wants to go ahead: 1) Don't expect the unreasonable - understand the limitations of your chosen surgery and if you don't like them, don't go ahead 2) Ask every question you think you might possibly need to know and do your research - being prepared makes everything easier 3) Do as you're told!  You're as responsible as HMG are for your recovery/results so if you have to wear the pressure pants non-stop for a whole week then do it!  Your recovery will be faster and your results better 4) If you're having liposuction then book yourself in for some medical lymphatic drainage massage afterwards - for as soon as you feel able - it reduces bruising, swelling and pain really quickly.  Overall I would recommend HMG, Allwin and Cat all very highly - they were brilliant throughout and I'm very happy with my results!",Positive,0.993,0,Liposuction,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,expensive,quick,staff,pain,research,0,happy,results

I was told having an incision under the armpit was possible, however In order to discuss this with the surgeon a minimum deposit of �500 was required. I put down my deposit, booked my surgery and assessment dates and met my surgeon. He then told me he could not do it under the arm. I was extremely dissapointed and was advised to have the incision under the breast and under the muscle. I then sort the advise of several other surgeons who told me about the submuscular procedure and how it was a simple procedure and around an 1hr long and I would be home that day. I spoke to several other patients about their procedures under I was comfortable with the decision of having it under the muscle with the incision under the breast (Inframammary approach). I was told �3990 upfront cost with no hidden costs and slightly more for the finance option. Now it is a few days before my surgery and I have now been told it is an overnight stay (which I was constantly assured is a personal option) and I will be charged an extra �710.

First off I couldn't thank the staff enough for being highly professional kind and caring and on my journey they offered me the upmost support you could ask for. Now unfortunately my treatments have come to and end I can honestly say I don't think it's worked for me it's reduced lots on certain areas of my face but unfortunately when I was going for my treatments I was told to still shave in between and because my cheeks were very blonde but very hairy and long they couldn't get rid of it as quick so because of this I was told to shave in between to get the hair to grow darker and thicker for past year Iv been doing so and now the treatments have come to and end I am unfortunately left with even hairier cheeks and more prominant, it has however knocked my confidence even more when the sun is shining I find myself trying to hide my face with anything I can il even wear a scarf when it's warm so that I can cover this. When I told the lady who treated me on my last couple of treatments this she was shocked and said that she never tells patients to continue shaving. Especially in areas they never did. Sadly I don't have the money to keep up with the treatments so apart from my neck Im sorry to say it has worsened and I have mixed feelings on wether to recommend the treatment to anyone. I think if you have a lot of money then go for it but for me 1000 for 8 treatments is hard to keep up with.

The tip of my nose is still very enlarged (bigger than before the operation), and I have a lump on one side of my nose, and an enlarged knuckled shape at the tip of my nose.  After spending about �5000 I am very disappointed as my old nose tip did not have the above issues and it seems unlikely there will be improvement and I would not want to go through the full operation again.  I was not made aware of potential problems following a rhinoplasty and was only shown photographs of good results so I think I should have been warned of the specific risks and I may then have given more balanced consideration to the operation.

Four years ago I visited destination skin for lip filler, this was the first time I had ever had lip filler and I believe I was 21-22 at the time...less then four weeks later I called back and said now the swelling had gone down I wanted them to be bigger... not long after/maybe even sooner the nurse injected another ml - this means 2ml was injected within the space of 6-8 weeks into my very small to begin with lips. 6 months later I finally found a voice and called them up to complain and voice my concerns, I was completely disregarded they said it had been to long to complain. Now older, I thought it was only fair to warn others of what has happened to my lips as a result of your companies incompetence. Not only is one side of my top lip bigger then the other, scar tissue has formed inside of the lip as a result of injury caused by YOUR company. I wish I was as clued up and knowledagble as I am now about filler, as I wouldn?��t have allowed the second ml to ever be put in. This is what happens when people take advantage of others for no reason then lining pockets. Every nurse I have spoken to since said they would have never put 2ML into anyone?��s lips of that size and especially not that close between appointments. My point is, that most companies or nurses would have said no, but yours didn?��t, and instead saw financial gain, and I now have a constant reminder of your incompetency and my immaturity on my face.",Negative,-0.2716,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Destination Skin,0,time,0,0,0,0,0,0

Along with several aborted phone calls, I also tried emailing them, asking them to call me. By the time they phoned me back - 24 hours later - it was too late.

This is a doctor who will quickly turn you away from unnecessary procedures and quell any unrealistic expectations. Seeing Dr Mountford made me realise just quite the poor levels of service and outcome I have always previously received. Patients are encouraged to get in touch with any concerns and a follow up appointment is made to ensure the work done is to the hugest standard and that everyone is happy.

I was informed that the fat pads on my cheeks needed to be done and this would help the tear troughs although work may be needed on them at a later date as well. At the time I agreed as it all made good sense. When it was done it looked quite good but was obviously swollen and blotchy from the needle. Have left it just over a week and there is very little difference and although they did explain we are all asymmetrical the difference between the two sides is even more noticeable now. Having the cheeks done seems to have pushed the skin up and made the bags under my eyes even more prominent.I am now going on vacation and can not see the Practitioner until beginning of May. I really liked the person who administered the injections but feel considering that two vials were used (without much discussion or cost implications) the outcome is disappointing. I have to save hard for the treatment and really hoped this would give me a little more self confidence but unfortunately it has not.

I had the remaining two sessions reinstated after lots of complaining that this was unacceptable - but apparently they are unable to schedule another appointment and are fully booked up for like EVER! I have complained- sent 3 emails...all unanswered and ignored. Not sure what is worse...conned, ripped off, lied to, racially insulted, burned and permanently scarred??? Can't decide.

AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!,My wife booked some laser hair removal through a Groupon offer at the Birmingham salon. She had two sessions and after the last session she paid �169 in advance for 6 more sessions. A day or so later she had a reaction to the laser treatment and no longer wanted to continue with the 6 sessions she had paid in advance for and kindly asked for a refund. The company emailed to say they were not prepared to refund her even though we hadn't started the treatments she paid for. We have since sent numerous emails/letters contesting this and asking for some for some further explanation as to why we weren't entitled to a refund for a service that has never been provided and we have been completely ignored. Two of our letters were sent recorded delivery to the Head Office and signed for but still no response. What kind of a company operates in this way?!?! It's absolutely disgusting the way they treat their customers once they have their money. We all work hard for our money and to refuse to refund our money and then be completely ignored is totally unacceptable.

The location is terrible, it?��s not a clinic, it?��s a run down building in digbeth , surrounded by pubs and sex shops. The place also has no sign outside, and is called a hairdressers. There?��s no disabled facilities and the reception is grotty, there were rat traps! Seriously! And the lady joked about it. I thought ok maybe it?��s a one time thing. I went to the room when I was collected and the treatment rooms are disgusting and dirty. The staff change constantly!!!!! Never the same person. The only reason I HAD to haven?��t treatments is because they DONT give refunds! At all! When I was given a ?��head office?�� number and address it didn?��t exist!!! It?��s shocking honestly.

To counter some of the bad reviews on here that seem to state that the laser hair removal doesn't work, take this from a current theoretical physics student who has extensively studied and even built simulations for lasers. Those who are complaining about a lack of it working are all girls who have very fine pale hair. Lasers have difficulty in working on this because it needs to get absorbed by the hair, which is a lot lot easier if your skin is pale and your hair if dark. This is because the darker colours absorb the light more and so by having a contrast it makes it easier as it acts like a 'target'.",Positive,0.6115,0,0,0,0,0,Laser Hair Removal,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,results

Great results on the area they have treated but a little disappointed some areas have been missed and I wasn't aware these are not included in the package I.e. Some of the labia and the outer/ inner peri-anal area. This was not clear at all when I booked and traditionally a Brazilian bikini is everything off except a strip of hair. It also isn't in the small print anywhere. I do believe this might have been intentional to try and sell me more treatments. However the areas that have been treated are almost hair free now! I just wish it was the entire area not just specific patches. I will try again and ask them for the next sessions but will probably end up purchasing more from another company to fix this.

His knowledge, expertise, genuine interest in each individual patient, and surgical skill are all exceptional.   He gives you his undivided attention, and discusses options, expected outcomes and risks, answers all questions, and collaborates with the patient to ensure you feel you have selected a course of action and treatment you are most comfortable with.  A consummate professional who cares.  Amongst other procedures, Dr. Sheth performed 2 challenging and extensive Moh's Surgeries on my neck and jawline several months apart because the 2 areas were too close to each other in proximity to perform both together due to how the skin flaps would have to be pulled, stretched and stitched to get the best long term cosmetic results.

Amongst other procedures, Dr. Sheth performed 2 challenging and extensive Moh's Surgeries on my neck and jawline several months apart because the 2 areas were too close to each other in proximity to perform both together due to how the skin flaps would have to be pulled, stretched and stitched to get the best long term cosmetic results.

The mole was fast-tracked for analysis and as soon as he had the result, Dr Sheth called me and let me know. I needed a second excision, and this was carried out just as smoothly and painlessly as the first. Dr Sheth and Leanne were very professional and did an excellent job, but they were also incredibly kind and reassuring, and made sure I had all the information I needed. I was also given a contact number for Dr Sheth, with the assurance that I could call him at any time. The discovery of a mole is unpleasant and frightening, but I could not have been in better hands.

When I developed Basal Cell Melanoma, Dr Sheth could not have been more helpful or professoinal, again taking time to do extensive tests and always giving sensitive advice.

There was some bruising afterwards, and some discomfort, but nothing that a couple of paracetamol couldn't handle.  There was minor swelling locally, but this went down within a day or two.

PHI Clinic,wider industry competitor,Annonymous,2017-02-20T20:30:07Z,5  stars,Miradry - for hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating),"I first experienced hyperhidrosis at the age of 11 years - I still remember my sister wanting to try my top on and will never forget her comment 'your so sweaty, the underams on this top are so wet! This is when I first noticed my sweating problem and since then I suffered everyday in silence. My teenage years were a nightmare - my school shirt and PE t-shirt was white which mean my big round patches where obvious and due to this embarassing problem I would never take off my school jumper even when I was baking in summer. I would never wear any colours apart from black and made out I do not like colourful tops. I did visit my gp who prescribed me strong deodorants, but these were so strong they would burn the skin under my arms and I would be in agony throughout the night - and to make things worse I would still sweat a little bit the next day and have wet patches but smaller ones compared to what I normally had. I tried every deodorant in the market but nothing worked. I searched and searched for treatments but I could not find anything which did not consist of having to go under the theatre. I did not want to risk having an operations as there was a lot of negative side effects of undergoing the operation so from then i left searching and continued to suffer from hyperhidrosis all throughout my teenage years and early twenties until I reached the age of 26. One day in April 2016 I was so frustrated of having wet pits that I started searching again and this time round Miradry came up. I had never heard of this treatment before and read and read for months - this treatment excited me however I thought this is too good to be true - this cant be as good as it sounds. So again I left the idea until one day in November I thought what do I have to loose? I will never know unless I  give it a try. From my months and months  of research I already knew of PHI clinic and chose to have my treatment in that clinic as it was closest to my work,",Negative,-0.8894,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,PHI Clinic,0,time,0,0,research,0,0,0

Despite experimenting with a variety of lightening creams and peels, I was extremely unhappy with the appearance of my eyes, even under makeup. I met Dr Tapan and he told me I was the ideal candidate for tear trough fillers. He said that by eradicating the groove and making it smoother, it would cast less of a shadow, thereby reducing the dark circles. Getting tear trough fillers was, without a doubt, the best decision I have ever made. The cirles under my eyes are substantially lighter and I am able to conceal them much more easily. It has made a huge difference to my self-confidence. Dr Tapan understood my problem straight away and provided me with a solution.

Mr Seno then came to see me and explained exactly what he would be doing, marked me up and then i was collected by the theatre staff. They were all so lovely and caring and made me feel much more relaxed.

Everything from my first consultation with my surgeon Dr Mileto to the surgery and after care received has been outstanding. I had my procedure done at the Clinic near Heathrow. I was a day surgery case had no pain at all. I decided to have this surgery as I had droopy lower lids and rather than eye bags I had malar mounds the puffyness was at the bottom of my eye almost at the top of my cheeks. It wasn?��t really bad but made me look tired for my age 43. 3 weeks after surgery I have no visible scars on my lids at all any my lower have a small scar that is fading fast Dr mileto chose the nip method under my eyes as it can be done slightly lower on the eye so wasn?��t directly under my lower lashes.  It has taken years off of me and I could not be happier with the results I no longer have to sit with ice packs on before going out to reduce the puffiness or use 3 concealers to try and mask my dark circles which have disappeared. My eyes look much bigger as they no longer have my droopy skin on my eyelids closing them. I took 2 weeks of work to recuperate and that was perfect timing. I went back to work feeling more confident than I felt in years.

However the hospital and aftercare was horrendous causing me to discharge less than 24 hours after operation and the day before I was supposed to leave. On 8th January I went in for a breast reduction and uplift with MR Ben Khoda. When arriving at the hospital I was taken into my room which was a basic hospital room. A nurse came to tell me to get ready quickly I was going to theatre. I rushed and got my theatre clothes on ready fo go and she told me she had the wrong person I have to wait a few more hours. I previously told the anethitst, my surgeon and a numerous of nurses with regards to my needle pheobia and how I was feeling about theatre. They walked me into the theatre room where I began to break down in tears as I was petrified. They tried to calm me down and made me drop my gown leaving me topless in front of many nurses. I was then told to lie on the bed and gassed so they began to do the procedure. Before I knew it I woken up in recovery. I was in recovery 10 minutes then taken to my room where I was left to my own devices with no help to the toilets or change my clothes out of my gown I had to rely on my parents which were in a hotel 3 miles down the road. The next morning I was woken up by the nurse at 5:50 giving me my breakfast as she left the door open and turned all the lights on people were having to check out there rooms before 6.30am with no help from the nurses to get there stuff together. At 8am I was due pain relief but by 10 to 10 with no pain relief still after asking 5 nurses I begged the cleaner which came in to change my bedding. The HCA made me get out of bed whilst in pain so she could change the bedding. This made my heart rate drop to 64 and caused me to pass out. I was then placed in a chair on oxygen whilst she changed my bed before she left the room she changed my water which I had from the previous day and Informed the nurse I needed pain relief and she had put me on oxygen. 10.15 my parents come to the hospital and yet again had to chase for my pain relief. At 2.15pm I was due pain relief which the nurse came in and handed me paracetamol and told me to set an alarm on my phone and take every 4 hours! I informed my surgeon what had happened when he come around and he advised that I was best of recovering at home.

My sisters personal advisor was easy to contact, professional and she had a seamless booking process. Whereas my advisor, although lovely, was unprepared and unorganised, she asked the same questions each time I spoke with her and was difficult to contact. The surgeon informed me I would be a day case, so the quote was based on this, once I selected my date I prepared my lift, finances and aftercare on being a day case. Yet when I went to pay off my bill, the amount I owed was more than I expected as they had me down for a night stay. Eventually this was sorted and the amount I owed was corrected. 2 days before my operation I received a phone call to say my admission time was early afternoon, which seemed odd considering I was a day case. When questioned I was told I was down for staying over night. It took three additional phone calls to have this corrected, thanks to Diane.",Positive,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I did find it slightly off putting that my patient advisor did not remember who I was after only a week of our last meeting and the surgeon seemed quick to get me in and out of our consultation.

Almost two hours later I was in a great sea of pain and presses my buzzer where another nurse came to see me and apologised informing me that Dan had not passed the message on. The communication within the Hospital Group is very poor. After paying my deposit I found it difficult to speak with my patient liaison advisor or anyone actually. At the time of my consultation I asked if my follow up appointments could be on a weekend and was assured they could be. Since having my procedure I have found out this is not the case and infact there has been a huge confusion about where I should actually be attending my follow up (Leeds or Sheffield).

I was so angry and so disappointed at the time! I called Elizabeth the same day and tried to ask her what happened? Why have they change their minds? She tried to convince me to sign that I agree for blood transfusion as she was 100% sure everything will be fine and I wont need one. (Discusting behaviour!!!) After 2 days I called them and told them I dont want to agree for blood transfusion and want my deposit back. Elizabeth said it can take up to 28 days. Didnt receive my money after 28 days so I called her again she said money should be on my account in 3 days.I checked my account still no money.. Called her again (3th time) to complain about whole situation and they sent me my deposit the same day...so finally after 35 long days I received my money back.

The Hospital Group,direct,Michaela Louise Dring,2018-10-15T13:12:01Z,3  stars,Great local clinic and great surgeon but poor hospital care,"Great local clinic and great surgeon but hospital care at Dolan Park was surprisingly poor. I was admitted at 09.00 yesterday and had to wait until 15.00 for my operation, they did apologize but I would've much preferred the comfort of my own home for a few more hours as I had to wake up at 5.30am for this early admission. They didn't have my post op bra ready or make any attempt to let me get one so after my surgery I was left without one and they didn't seem to realise until they checked up on me 2 hours later. Once this was eventually on, the surgeon came in, checked all was ok and I was able to tell him where certian pains were so he could see if they were normal and luckily they were. My blood pressure was then taken every 2 hours but a different nurse each time unfortunately so I had to repeat anything previously said as no one wrote it down... I got offered food rather late in the day so was a bit disappointed as I had to waste most of it as it was so uncomfortable for me to eat with limited movement. 2 of the nurses were lovely and polite but 3 of them were very rude and I am surprised they are allowed to be like that. In the morning, I asked for elp putting my new bra on and she looked at me with disgust and confusion and then left swiftly without adjusting my straps and said I could do it myself! Despite being initially annoyed with an early discharge as I was definitely not feeling up to it, I was glad to leave and begin recovery at home. My driver home Shirley was lovely, she had also had the same surgery so could sympathize and make sure I was comfy. She was very friendly and carried all my bags to my hallway so this ended the experience on a high. I'm only a day into recovery and have my nurse appointment already booked for next Monday so hopefully the aftercare will now improve. Real shame I felt rushed and dismissed bearing in mind this a private hospital where people spend a lot of money in. Thank you to my surgeon Dr Seno though and I hope if I am to return I am treated much better. It was a busy hospital and appreciate there is lots to do but we are all paying a lot of money for this service and it's not right we should be made to feel rushed when we are in pain.

Also my first check up was rearranged by them which was fine the first time, only for them to call me on my 2nd check up and say rather than waiting 1 week between appointments they expect me to wait 3 WEEKS before I see anyone. That to me is disgusting. After raising my concern to them when they phoned to change that appointment I said could I have a call back from the nurse to ask whether I keep bandage or or not, I was told I would get a call back and still 4 days later I hadn't received a call back.

It?��s a good job I wasn?��t fully out of it after my surgery to realise! They also left me in a bloody gown until later in the day when I could be released. No food was given when I said I was hungry which I know sounds trivial after having surgery but I?��d not eaten since 7am the previous morning so I was bound to be. When I finally got something it was a yogurt...dissapointing. The nurses and staff were also rude to my family when they were there and make us feel very uncomfortable. I wrote a letter of complaint to the hospital group about scarring and the treatment I received which was pretty much fobbed off. I paid good money for this surgery and expected much much better. such a shame. I?��m having to pay for treatment for my scarring as it?��s left me feeling down but what does that matter to them eh. Once they have your money it?��s game over. Anyway I know for the future and will not recommend the hospital group to anyone wanting cosmetic surgery.,Negative,-0.953,Cosmetic Surgery,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,The Hospital Group,0,0,staff,0,0,0,helpful,0

The Hospital Group,direct,Mrs Burton,2018-06-28T15:21:58Z,3  stars,Second procedure with Renato,"I returned to the hospital group following my first augmentation 12 years ago as i wanted the same surgeon, knowing that the first procedure was smoothe and professional. I was given a care co-ordinator aswel as my surgeon that basically does the paperwork side of things. The surgeon (Renato Z) is kind and professional, knowing his high level of experience, I felt safe in his hands. At bromsgrove the nurses I had prior to surgery and following surgery on the initial day were wonderful however my experience following the procedure was completely different. When I came round from anaesthetic in the recovery room, the man sat beside me watching over me was distracted by two other members of staff showing him pictures on their mobile phone which they were discussing. I kept attempting to get his attention in a half come round state, crying with pain and scared but despite my attempts he continued to be distracted by these two ladies. Eventually when they left he helped calm me down....Since surgery I have felt highly concerned about the fact that a mobile phone has been allowed in an environment where patients are under anaesthetic with little clothing. I have informed staff and will be writing a formal letter of complaint about this. This was an unacceptable distraction and extremely unprofessional of staff members. The only other complaint was the nurse on duty the following morning following surgery, having only had surgery at 5pm the night before, and not coming back into the ward until around 8pm, and also having a caring night nurse, I was shocked to be abruptly asked around 8am why I hadn't got up and got dressed to be discharged for 10am. This nurse, unlike the other nurses i had looking after me the previous day, was very blunt and made me feel uncomfortable like they'd done their job and now it was time for me to go. I even got an annoyed glance when i requested for the times to be written down that i had taken medication in the last 24 hours to ensure I didn't overdose at home. She made me feel like I was in the way. This was not the type of experience I would expect to have when paying �6000 for surgery.... being a mother of three, that sort of money doesn't come easy so I would of expected better care. I had observations done throughout the night but no surgeon seen me the next morning and my wounds were not checked before discharge in any way at all the next morning, despite me asking if they should be. Following surgery I had lots of questions which the ward have answered politely each time I've called and also some illness in which I was readmitted by my clinic nurse, I had an overnight stay with IV antibiotics and everyone was caring and made me feel comfortable. The clinic nurse took out my stitches and was very gentle and calm with me. I was happy with my surgeon and the most of the experience with the hospital group however I do have concerns regarding how I was treated following surgery at bromsgrove.

I was nil by mouth from midnight and was told that i wouldnt be going down to theatre till 4 so could drink water till 2 hours before. The nurse went to fetch me some water and that was it. I waited for around an hr and no one came back with any water. I went out to the station and the nurses were sat eating chocolate. My nurse then jumped up and apologised and said she had forgotten me! I eventually got my water and waited to be called. 7 hours later!!!! During this time the anaesthetist and recovery drs came and saw me briefly and i saw the surgeon for all of 2 seconds. No one came to inform me what was happening. I went out twice  to the nurses station to be told they would find out but never got back to me.  The surgery all went fine and i was bought back to the ward and on a positive note the 2 nurses throughout the night shift were absolutely amazing and cannot praise them enough.

Lucky and quickly the nhs got me seen and everything was fine. But a year on my breath are horrible because of my pregnancy. I paid �5000 for them to be even worse after and my scars are horrendous!

The Hospital Group,direct,Karen Tomney,2018-02-07T14:20:58Z,1  stars,"constant cancellations of surgery, surgeon, hospital and city.. Fought for refund","When I saw the title ""The Hospital Group"" I actually thought it was a chain fo hospitals, I  went to a local consultation with a nurse in Glasgow regarding weight loss surgery, signed a contract with a date for surgery with a named hospital and surgeon.  I paid �10,000.  I was told I would need a pre-surgery assessment, and appointments with a dietician.  I had some telephone conversations with dieticians about the pre-operative liver reducing diet I was on, and I lost 2 stone in 6 weeks.  During the time I was involved with them, it was nothing but incompetence and a nightmare experience.  When I hadn't had my pre-operative check (and I was on blood thinners and didn't know when to stop taking them) I kept contacting Julie Stansfield who was assigned to me and the dietician who was concerned about this.  Nothing happened.  Then only through me constantly contacting them for an update, with less than a week to go till surgery in Leeds, (from Scotland) the surgery had been CANCELLED and they hadn't even told me!!!  Then I was told I could have another date, but at a different hospital and city, and a different surgeon, and also I'd have to go to meet that surgeon at Newcastle.  They wanted me to travel to Newcastle for the surgeon's consultation, then back home and a couple of days later travel to Birmingham for the surgery with a totally different surgeon.  Then that was CANCELLED and an appointment with a surgeon at Nuffield Leeds was made for a pre-surgery assessment.  When I met the surgeon he said the surgery had to be cancelled because I should have been off the blood thinners (I kept asking them about) should have ceased.  I had to have bloods done then.  So yet again another cancellation due to negligence.  I was frustrated and hurt at being mucked around.  I was told by the coordinator Julie Stansfield that if it was cancelled again they would refund me all my money.  That wasn't true.  They refused to refund me.  The surgeon said he would do the surgery and cut out the hospital group.  However I couldn't get my money back from them.  They REFUSED to refund me and threatened and made me feel intimidated.  The only way to get my money's worth was to have the operation.  I didn't trust anyone involved with the surgery now, and was terrified.  To me, the company had the money and then did not care about the patient.  I HAD to agree to the surgery or loose ever penny I'd got into debt for.  Then I was told I had something seriously wrong with my liver that had shown up on the blood results, and the surgery was cancelled again, and it was demanded that  I see a liver specialist and have scans done.  My gp said it was needless, he did bloods and they were fine, turned out the antibiotics I was on for an infection had affected their results, and they didn't listen to the advice of my gp.  More needless procedures that needed paying for.  I had no more money to see a private specialist, and was therefore in limbo,  I couldn't have the surgery and couldn't get my money back.  I wrote several letters to them.  I also emailed.  Each time they ignored me, and the coordinator Julie stopped taking phone calls from me.  They were in breach of contract I was informed, and also I tried to cancel the contract as it said that you had 14 days (I think it was) to cancel the contract from the date of the doctors consultation.  They refused to accept this blaming me.  I had to go to the Consumer Protection Agency, Trading Standards and spoke to the Care Commission.  Eventually after reaching breaking point this company finally paid me my money back.  The manager who was dealing with me was intimidating, and it felt that the company would do anything to hold on to the money.  I since researched them and found other stories from the media and online about other people who have had challenging experiences with them.  They seem more like surgery brokers who charge more than the surgeon who carries out the operation.  Thousands more I discovered.  I recommend going to a hospital direct.  Read your contract carefully, as sometimes we are so desperate we just sign it and don't check.  You can also be signing that you don't mind being recorded during your interviews.  I lost a lot of money with all the changes of city and hospital for pre-surgery appointments and the operation itself, in hotel costs, lost earning from my hubbies employment etc.,  As I had constant cancellations of surgery, I was on the pre-operative liver reducing diet (which is severely frugal) too long because of the changes to surgery dates.  I lost 2 stones in 6 weeks (diet went on longer) and my hair fell out, despite taking supplements.  My experience left me traumatised.  I needed weight loss surgery for health reasons, and I was let down very badly.  I note the reply below from the Hospital Group says a refund was made promptly.  It was not made promptly.  It was refused over and over again.  I had to write copious emails and letters and make numerous phone calls to an uncooperative manager.  Eventually had to seek advice from CAB, Trading Standards, CPA etc., It was a terrible struggle.",Negative,-0.9983,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,The Hospital Group,charge,time,care,0,online,0,0,results

The reason I will only be giving 3 stars is that it was Dolan park that was a let down for me the reception area was beautiful then I got taken to my room at 10 to be told my operation wouldn?��t be till 5 I travelled alone so had a boring day ahead once the nurse had finished I was left at 10:30 baring in mind they knew I was alone nobody came in to see I was ok till 15:30!! Yes I know the nurses are busy but felt like I was a burden!! My room was also very dated and should be of a higher standard baring in mind the amount of money patients are spending!! Another huge disappointment is the noisy animals outside the room it was soo frustrating I was just glad I only needed to spend one night there as it would be impossible to rest and relax with the noise!! The operation.. the surgeon did an amazing job and once taken back to my room the night staff nurses were amazing they could teach the day staff a thing or two!! Another downfall from me is that the surgeon didn?��t come back to check your ok or to ask any questions when I asked the nurse if it went ok she said she didn?��t know!! Iv had other procedures done in the past privately and I have to say this was the worst but on a positive note the surgery went fine!! Follow up has been ok a nurse called I had to get in contact with another nurse to ask a question where again I felt like a burden on the phone!! Making follow up appointments has also been a let down I was told I?��d be able to follow up at Manchester due to it being closer to home which I said a Friday afternoon or a Saturday would be preferable but now iv had the treatment I?��m not able to do so.. disappointing!! I think overall I probably wouldn?��t use the hospital group again and should have maybe listened to the negatives but it?��s done now and I?��m here to tell the tale.. maybe if the hospital had a makeover, nurses learnt some bedside manner and the truth could be told before monies are exchanged this would have been a 5 stat review I actually feel I?��m being very generous providing you with 3 stars!!",Positive,0.9804,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,The Hospital Group,0,busy,staff,0,0,0,glad,beautiful

The nurse was unable to answer my questions so I called the Hospital Group. The woman on the phone said that things can change and that on the operating table the surgeon can decide what's best. This is fair enough, but why did no one inform me afterwards that they had been placed above the muscle? I got a call from the clinic the next day to say I will need to see the surgeon if I want to know what happened and he won't be in for another 2 weeks. So I have now got to go back in a fortnight to find out what exactly happened. I find it odd that it wouldn't be documented on the notes and so someone could explain to me what happened over the phone rather than having to go back.

I felt very uncomfortable and even my aunty mentioned during summer holidays that even her boobs weren?��t as sogy and she is in her mid 50?��s - I think this had pushed me to do the research.",Positive,0.6815,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,time,0,0,online,0,0,0

The following day I returned home due to not wanting a repeat of the night before and cut my stay short. The aftercare was disgusting, very unorganised and was excepted to travel to different clinics after specifically saying before I agreed to the surgery I wanted my aftercare at my chosen clinic and this was agreed in my consultation. I was constantly chasing for aftercare appointments and non had been made and I had been forgotten about. Once the company have your money they loose all lack of care for you.

I was told they would call 2 weeks prior to my op to let me know what I should be doing with my diet. My phone had no signal and they never attempted to call land line or e mail me. 10 days before my op I go for pre op. Nurse was lovely and asked how I was getting on with my diet and had I lost weight. I had no idea I should of been dieting for 2 weeks before my op. Was told if I didn't lose enough weight my op would be cancelled. I then had to crash diet drinking only 2 slim fast a day. I had opted for the gastric sleeve. Anyway I managed to lose enough weight to continue. The day of my op I was told to arrive at 13.30. My op however turned out to be 19.30. My op went ahead and was successful. I was put in my room to totally  come round. I woke as needed the toilet. I called for the nurse and was told I couldn't possibly need the loo as I hadn't had a drink for hrs. At this point I said no I do need the loo and I would go with or without her help. Eventually she relented and helped me to the loo. It wasn't her fault as she told me she was the only nurse and had double figure patients to look after and they were all coming round. I paid �9000 and expected a little more. I was told the next day I could leave.  The dietician phoned me 4 days later and said was normal for it to be difficult to swallow much. I was concerned as I could only manage 1 slim fast a day. As she said it got easier to swallow. I was losing a lot of weight fast. After 6 weeks dietician called. She said I had to eat more protein as the weight loss was probably muscle loss and not fat. I was only eating protein as still struggling to eat enough. At this point she said I had to eat fruit and vege too. The only suggestion she came up with was a protein yogurt yet she told me I was to eat crackers and more solid foods. I do believe she didn't listen to a word I said and was just going through a tick check. Not happy,Negative,-0.9593,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,service,0,0,0,happy,0

The Hospital Group,direct,HB,2017-11-20T17:10:06Z,3  stars,Consider all options,"I chose to have a gastric bypass. The initial consultation was good, the date for surgery was organised but there was some confusion over certain details like the pre-op. I had a dietician call me weekly whilst doing the liver reduction diet which kept me on track but I think that you should speak to the same dietician throughout your journey. I also had some hassle regarding my dietician appointments when they cancelled and rearranged but still called me for the cancelled appointment! On another occasion I waited for a call (which i never received) only to then receive quite a rude email saying I had failed to attend my appointment! I phoned and spoke with someone who reckoned I had been called 3 times. I had no missed calls or voicemails. I had my operation at Spire Parkway mid October and the staff were great.  The hospital was clean and well presented. I had nurse call me from The Hospital Group on my discharge day to check everything went ok. I had a follow up dietician appointment a few days after. During this appointment I was told to do liquid diet for 2 weeks then move onto pureed. A week later i had another dietician phone me and she told me I had to do liquids for 4 weeks! I explained the previous dietician had said 2 weeks as well as my surgeon. This new dietician basically said that it was at my risk if i move onto the next stage too quick. I appreciate that but surely all the hospital group dieticians should be working from the same policies and procedures? I was then told I wouldn't get a call until January 2018 which personally I think is poor service. When you have gone through such a huge lifestyle change (and paid out a large sum of money to have the privilege of having the op done without having to wait long) I would expect more support. Up to now I have not been impressed with the aftercare.

The hospital staff and mr surgeon were very nice. My issue with this company is that the aftercare team do not respond to calls or texts in a timely manner or even at all just recently for me. In my case I had a wound open up which my surgeon said required a couple stitches. This wasn't a huge deal for as they told me I could just come down to Weymouth street to get it done. Then I got a phone call saying I would have to make my own way down to near Birmingham (120 miles approx each way). When you pay for your surgical procedure it comes with transport to and from the hospital. On the day of my surgery I made my own way down. I asked if they would be able to provide me transport to the hospital for the stitches which they declined as transport was only for people going in to have surgery. I felt they could have been abit more lenient as I hadn't used their services the first time so it's not costing them any further expense. Potential customers need to be aware that any minor medical procedure post op will have to be done at Dolan park hospital.
